# Research Note: Public-Key Encryption from the Endomorphism Ring Problem

**Date.** 2026-10-10, revised 2026-10-11 after a first prototype. **Status.**
Literature survey, design proposal, and a SageMath toy prototype of the
complete KeyGen/Encaps/Decaps path (`research/eigen_seta_prototype_20261011/`).
Parameter figures are derived estimates, not measurements; the prototype runs
at toy sizes only. **Goal addressed.** Devise a strategy for a *novel* public-key
encryption (PKE/KEM) scheme whose trapdoor is the endomorphism ring End(E) of
the public curve, building on primitives that exist today (Deuring
correspondence, Kani/higher-dimensional isogenies, lollipop attacks).
**Conductor.** `conductor check` could not reach a control plane in this
session (connection refused on localhost:8080); the note is filed under the
hook's warn-through path.

Sections 1-3 are established results with citations. Section 4 is the
proposal; the algebra there is ours and is marked as derived. Section 5 is
the cryptanalysis checklist and Section 6 the experiment protocol. Section 7
lists requirement status.

## 1. What the problem actually is

### 1.1 Hardness of EndRing (what the trapdoor is worth)

| Statement | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| EndRing ⇔ ℓ-IsogenyPath ⇔ MaxOrder (poly-time, GRH) | Wesolowski, FOCS 2021, ePrint 2021/919 | proved |
| EndRing ⇔ OneEnd ⇔ Isogeny (arbitrary degree), unconditional; worst-case ⇒ average-case | Page–Wesolowski EC 2024 (2023/1399); Herlédan Le Merdy–Wesolowski TCC 2025 (2025/271) | proved |
| Best classical: Õ(p^{1/2}) low memory; heuristic p^{1/3+o(1)} time *and* memory | EHLMP 2018; Wesolowski 2026/1486 (July 2026); Mamah 2026/1821 (concrete: p^{1/3} does not beat p^{1/2} at practical memory except maybe level I) | heuristic |
| Best quantum: Õ(p^{1/4}) (Grover / Biasse–Jao–Sankar); nothing subexponential for unstructured curves | SQIsign v2 spec §10.2.1; Mamah 2026/1821 | state of the art |
| One known non-scalar endomorphism α ⇒ classical |disc Z[α]|^{1/4}, quantum subexponential | Herlédan Le Merdy–Wesolowski CiC 2025 (2023/1448) | proved (GRH) |
| Any full-rank suborder, or an isogeny representation from a known-End curve ⇒ End in quantum poly time (IsERP) | Chen–Imran–Ivanyos–Kutas–Leroux–Petit AC 2023 (2023/779); Chen–Petit EC 2025 | proved |

Consequences for a design: the public key may be a curve and nothing else that
is "End-shaped". Publishing an endomorphism, an orientation, a suborder, or an
evaluable isogeny from a known-End curve collapses the hardness to
|disc|^{1/4} / subexponential / quantum-polynomial respectively. Also budget
p ≈ 2^{3λ} rather than 2^{2λ} if the 2026 p^{1/3} line is taken at face value;
the SQIsign round-3 primes were reportedly changed for this reason (2026/2221).

### 1.2 The structural obstruction

Given End(E_A) only, computing an isogeny E_A → E_C for a fresh E_C is
poly-time *equivalent* to computing End(E_C) (Page–Wesolowski Thm 8.5 and
Prop. 8.4; unconditional in 2025/271). So the owner of End(E_A) cannot invert
"send me a random curve isogenous to E_A". A PKE must put a **hint** in the
ciphertext, and the whole design question is: which hint is (a) useless to
everyone, (b) decodable with End(E_A), (c) cheap.

### 1.3 The only two known mechanisms for isogeny PKE

1. **Commutative group actions** (CSIDH, SCALLOP, PEGASIS/qt-Pegasis, CORAL).
   The orientation must be public for the sender to act, so vectorization is
   quantum-subexponential (Kuperberg); 2026/2215 puts NIST-1 at a 4096-bit
   base field. OSIDH tried a partially hidden orientation and was broken
   (Dartois–De Feo PKC 2022). Not EndRing-hard in the sense the user asked for.
2. **Torsion-point hints** (SIDH family: FESTA, QFESTA, POKÉ, PIKE, INKE,
   LIT-SiGamal, SILBE, Séta). Hints are torsion images hidden by a subgroup
   Γ ≤ GL₂(Z/N) (De Feo–Fouotsa–Panny EC 2024, 2024/459): Γ trivial or
   unipotent ⇒ polynomial for anyone (Robert 2022: N² > d suffices); scalar Γ
   (M-SIDH) and diagonal Γ (FESTA's CIST) ⇒ only exponential attacks known on
   generic curves.

Open-problem status: Castryck–De Feo–Galbraith–Kutas–Reijnders–Wesolowski,
"The isogeny problems" (ePrint 2026/1431), Problem 7 (De Feo): *build
encryption/KEM/IBE whose security reduces to a small variant of EndRing.*
Open as of Oct 2026. Problem 6 (Castryck): classical End transfer along an
arbitrary isogeny representation, also open.

## 2. Prior art that is "End(E) as trapdoor"

| Scheme | Trapdoor | Ciphertext hint | Why it is where it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Séta** (AC 2021, 2019/1291) | a curve built around a secret endomorphism θ (Petit's torsion attack as decryptor); needed N > D² | *exact* torsion images of a known-degree isogeny | broken 2022: Robert needs no θ once N² > d. Keygen 10.4 h, decryption 10.7 min in 2021. |
| **M-SIDH / MD-SIDH** (EC 2023, 2023/013) | key exchange, no trapdoor | scalar-masked images, N with ≥ 2λ prime factors | Weil pairing leaks λ² so only 2^{ω(N)} masks; needs E_0 of *unknown* End because any known endomorphism gives the lollipop ψ = φθφ̂ with the mask cancelled; 5911-bit p at level 1 |
| **Castryck–Vercauteren** (AC 2023, 2023/1433) | attack, not a scheme | generalised lollipop ψ = φ'∘ω∘φ̂, Lemma 3: the mask cancels iff the matrix of ω on E_0[N] lies in the centraliser of Γ; needs N > d√w | scalar masks: any ω works; F_p-rational E_0 is broken with unknown End (Frobenius). Diagonal masks (FESTA): only if P or Q is an *eigenvector* of ω. §5.3: a rigged eigenbasis is a *backdoor*, "near impossible to verify" when End(E_0) is unknown; they recommend hashing the basis. |
| **SILBE** (SAC 2024, 2024/400) | pk = any curve E_A; sk = φ_A: E_0 → E_A from F_p-rational E_0 (⇔ End(E_A)); decrypt with the Frobenius lollipop in dimension 4 | scalar-masked images (the mask *is* the message) | OW-PCA ⇔ "SIP + masked torsion"; first UPKE not from group actions; **p = 13 013 bits** at λ=128 because the scalar mask forces ω(N) ≥ 881 primes. Authors: "not yet practical". |
| **UPKE from FESTA** (AC 2026, 2026/1014) | dim-4 FESTA trapdoor; End of two curves used only for key update ("ConstrainedIsogeny") | diagonal-masked images | pk 0.4 KiB, ct 2.13 KiB; orders of magnitude faster than SILBE; assumption CIST² + IND-KLPT |
| FESTA / QFESTA / POKÉ / PIKE | secret isogeny from a *known-End* E_0 plus masks | diagonal (FESTA) or scalar (POKÉ) masks | key recovery is a torsion-hint problem, not EndRing. POKÉ: 431-bit p, pk 324 B, ct 648 B, ≈100 ms Sage. FESTA: 1292-bit p, pk 561 B, ct 1122 B. |
| pSIDH (Leroux 2022) | End(E_A) via suborder representation | the suborder itself | quantum-polynomial break (2023/779, Chen–Petit 2025) |

Reading of the table: the lollipop is the *only* published mechanism by which
End(E_A) decodes a hint that nobody else can decode, and its only published
instantiation (SILBE) is parametrically dead because it uses **scalar** masks,
whose security is 2^{ω(N)}. Diagonal masks have 2^{Ω(log N)} security but, by
CV Lemma 3, are lollipop-decodable only from an eigenbasis. CV treated the
eigenbasis as a backdoor to be eliminated. Nobody has used it as the
legitimate receiver's trapdoor. That is the gap this note proposes to fill.

## 3. The decoding lemma (why the design space is what it is)

Let φ: E_A → E_C have degree d, let (P,Q) be a basis of E_A[N], and let the
ciphertext reveal Λ = φ∘D on E_A[N], where D ∈ Γ ≤ GL₂(Z/N) is the sender's
mask written in the basis (P,Q). For θ ∈ End(E_A) with matrix M on E_A[N],
the receiver can compute

  Λ ∘ M ∘ (d·Λ⁻¹) = φ D M D⁻¹ φ̂   on E_C[N].

This equals the lollipop ψ_θ := φθφ̂ exactly iff D M = M D. (This is CV
Lemma 3 with σ₀ = id; the derivation above is a one-line restatement.) Hence:

* Γ = scalars: every θ works (M-SIDH, SILBE), but security is 2^{ω(N)}.
* Γ = diagonal in basis (P,Q): works iff M is diagonal, i.e. (P,Q) is an
  eigenbasis of θ. The centraliser of a non-scalar θ mod N is exactly the
  diagonal torus, so **diagonal masks are the largest mask set compatible
  with a single secret endomorphism**; two non-commuting endomorphisms would
  force scalars again.
* Once ψ_θ is known on E_C[N] with N² > deg ψ_θ = d²·n(θ), Kani/Robert gives
  ψ_θ as an explicit isogeny, and ker φ̂ = ker ψ_θ ∩ E_C[d] (generic case,
  CV §3.2). So the torsion requirement is **N > d·√n(θ)**, and the receiver's
  cost is one 2^e-isogeny chain in dimension 2, 4 or 8.
* Parity (found while implementing). An eigenbasis of θ on E_A[2^e] with
  eigenlines of full order exists iff 2 splits in Z[θ], i.e. disc(Z[θ]) ≡ 1
  mod 8, i.e. t odd and w even. Then one eigenvalue is even, so ψ_θ + [c] has
  even degree for every c and the Kani kernel degenerates at the 2-torsion.
  The fix is to decode with the trace-zero element θ' := 2θ − t (norm
  Δ' := 4w − t² ≡ 7 mod 8, same eigenlines, eigenvalues ±s₀ with s₀² ≡ −Δ'
  mod 2^{e+2}); ψ' := φθ'φ̂ then has odd eigenvalues ±d·s₀ and the Kani
  scalars satisfy **c² + c'² = N² − d²Δ'** with c even, c' odd. Because θ' is
  diagonal with odd eigenvalues, it acts as the identity on E_C[2], so the
  (2,2)-chain necessarily starts with product-to-product steps (the kernel's
  2-torsion is the diagonal of E_C[2]²) before gluing into a Jacobian; the
  FESTA and Castryck–Decru chain code (glue once, split once) cannot run it,
  and a general stepper is needed (implemented in `kani_chain.py`).

Everything else in the hint taxonomy is either decodable by everyone
(unmasked, single point with square N), or not decodable by anyone known
(Borel; any hint with N² < d — the surveys found no End-only decoder there,
and no impossibility proof either).

## 4. Proposal: Eigen-Séta (working name)

Séta's trapdoor one-way function with the torsion images masked by a
sender-random **diagonal** matrix in a **secret eigenbasis**. Equivalently:
the Castryck–Vercauteren FESTA backdoor, used by its rightful owner.

### 4.1 Scheme (KEM form; derived, not yet implemented)

Parameters: p = 2^e·3^f·c − 1, N = 2^e, d = 3^f, with 3^f ≈ 2^{2λ} and e
fixed by §4.3. Everything lives in F_{p²}.

**KeyGen.**
1. Walk from E_0 (j = 1728) with a secret isogeny of degree > 2^{4λ} to a
   statistically uniform E_A; keep the connecting ideal, so End(E_A) = O_A is
   known explicitly (SQIsign-style; Deuring tooling: "Deuring for the people"
   2023/106, ideal-to-isogeny in dimension 2 as in SQIsign2D-West 2024/760).
2. Enumerate short non-scalar θ ∈ O_A (LLL on the rank-3 trace-zero lattice;
   shortest norm ≈ p^{2/3} for a random maximal order, CV Remark 9). Pick θ
   with trace t, norm w, Δ' := 4w − t² such that
   (i) −Δ' is a non-zero square modulo 2^e (so θ is diagonalisable on E_A[2^e]
       with distinct eigenvalues μ ≠ ν mod 2), and
   (ii) N² − d²Δ' is a sum of two squares c² + c'² (c even, c' odd; e.g. a
        prime ≡ 1 mod 4) for a dimension-2 decryption, §4.2.
   Re-sample θ (thousands of short vectors are available) or E_A until both
   hold; (i) has density ≈ 1/4 among odd Δ', (ii) ≈ 1/(2 ln N²) ≈ 1/700 for a
   prime, more if composite values are accepted.
3. Compute an eigenbasis (P,Q) of θ on E_A[2^e] (evaluate θ on a basis via its
   explicit representation; solve the 2×2 eigenproblem mod 2^e).
4. pk = (E_A, P, Q). sk = (s₀ = μ − ν mod 2^e and the Cornacchia solution
   (c, c') of (ii); θ itself is not needed at decryption time).

**Encaps.**
1. Sample s ← Z/3^f and nonces a, b ← (Z/2^e)^×, all derived from a seed.
2. K := P_d + [s]Q_d for a canonical basis (P_d, Q_d) of E_A[3^f]; φ: E_A →
   E_C := E_A/⟨K⟩ (3-isogeny chain, length f).
3. ct = (E_C, S := [a]φ(P), T := [b]φ(Q)); key = H(seed, ct).

**Decaps.**
1. Let θ' = 2θ − t and ψ' := φθ'φ̂ ∈ End(E_C), degree d²Δ'. Then
   ψ'(S) = [d·s₀]S and ψ'(T) = [−d·s₀]T, and ψ̂' = −ψ'.
   (Derived: ψ'(aφP) = aφθ'(φ̂φP) = a d φ(θ'P) = a d s₀ φ(P). The nonces never
   enter.) So ψ' acts on E_C[2^e] by known scalars, for free.
2. Kani in dimension 2: with α := ψ' + [c] and c² + c'² = N² − d²Δ', the matrix
   F = [[α, c'], [−c', α̂]] is an (N², N²)-isogeny of E_C² with kernel
   {(c'x, −αx) : x ∈ E_C[N²]}, whose N-torsion part ⟨(c'S, −(ds₀+c)S),
   (c'T, −(c−ds₀)T)⟩ is known. Compute F as two N-halves from the actions of
   α and α̂ (SQIsignHD technique; see §4.3 on why the halves are essential),
   then α(X) is the first component of F(X, 0) and c'X the second, which also
   fixes the component isomorphisms of the split codomain.
3. ker φ̂ = ker(α − c) ∩ E_C[3^f] (cyclic of order d for generic θ'; otherwise
   try the few cyclic order-d subgroups, CV §3.2); recover φ, hence K and s;
   recompute a, b from the seed, re-encrypt, compare (FO with implicit
   rejection; s₀ is secret and used in step 1, so malformed ciphertexts must
   never reach a non-rejecting path — compare the Moriya–Onuki adaptive attacks
   on FESTA).

### 4.2 Why dimension 2 is available without Séta-style curve engineering

Kani needs deg(ψ' + [c]) + c'² = N², i.e. c² + c'² = N² − d²Δ' (θ' has trace
zero). The right side depends on θ only through Δ', so the receiver *chooses*
θ among its short endomorphisms until N² − d²Δ' is a sum of two squares and
solves with Cornacchia; the parities c even, c' odd are automatic because
N² − d²Δ' ≡ 1 mod 8. Séta had to construct the curve around a norm equation;
here the curve is random and only the choice of θ is constrained. Dimension 4
works with any θ (N² − d²Δ' − c² as a sum of two squares over a free c),
dimension 8 always works.

### 4.3 Parameter estimate at λ = 128 (derived, not measured)

Constraints: MITM on the 3^f-isogeny ⇒ 3^f ≳ 2^{2λ}; decoding needs
N > d√w; w ≈ p^{2/3} for a random curve (CV Remark 9); p ≈ N·d.
Solving N ≈ d·(Nd)^{1/3} gives N ≈ d², p ≈ d³:

| quantity | value | note |
|---|---|---|
| d = 3^f | 3^162 ≈ 2^257 | sender's degree |
| N = 2^e | e ≈ 515 | eigenbasis torsion; N > d·p^{1/3} |
| p | ≈ 2^772 | vs FESTA 1292, POKÉ 431, SILBE 13013 bits |
| pk | ≈ 2·97 B (E_A) + 2·65 B (P,Q compressed relative to a canonical basis) ≈ 325 B | |
| ct | ≈ 193 B (E_C) + ≈ 130 B (S,T compressed) ≈ 325 B | |
| decaps | one (2^515, 2^515)-isogeny chain in dimension 2 plus a 3^162 kernel recovery | FESTA-class cost; C implementations of comparable chains run in tens of ms (SQIsign2D-West verification class) |
| key recovery | EndRing(E_A): classical p^{1/2} ≈ 2^386, heuristic p^{1/3} ≈ 2^257, quantum p^{1/4} ≈ 2^193 | far above target; the ciphertext problem is the binding constraint |

**Why the two halves are essential.** The table assumes the (N², N²)-isogeny
is computed from N-torsion as two N-halves (N² > deg). With a *single* chain
(N > deg, the FESTA/Castryck–Decru regime) the condition becomes
N > d²Δ' ≈ 4d²p^{2/3} with N ≤ p, which forces p > d^9 ≈ 2^{18λ}; and for
curves near E_0 every odd-trace endomorphism has norm ≥ p/(4D_A) (D_A the
walk degree), which the prototype confirmed (shortest admissible norms were
exactly p/(4D_A)-sized), so a single chain never fits. In Richelot/Mumford
form the second half needs the dual chain plus an explicit isomorphism of the
middle Jacobians; in theta coordinates (SQIsignHD, SQIsign2D) duals are
explicit. The prototype implements only the single-chain regime and therefore
only the two special-key variants below.

If one instead engineers θ Séta-style with w ≈ 4d² (so that N² − d²Δ' is
small), the same p ≈ d³ results; the random-curve route is preferred because
its key-recovery problem is plain EndRing plus a leakage term (§5.1).

**Special-key variant actually prototyped ("hidden CM curve").** Take E_cm with
CM by Z[(1+√−7)/2] (j = −3375, supersingular when p ≡ 3, 5, 6 mod 7); its
degree-2 endomorphism ω has t = ±1, w = 2, Δ' = 7. Walk away by a secret
isogeny ε of odd degree D_A and use θ = εωε̂ (t = ±D_A, w = 2D_A², Δ' = 7D_A²).
This is CV §5.3's backdoor used by its owner: key recovery means finding ε
(MITM √D_A) or the endomorphism of norm 7D_A² (cycle search √(7)D_A), so
D_A ≈ 2^{2λ}, Δ' ≈ 2^{4λ}, and with two halves N ≈ d·√Δ' ≈ 2^{4λ}, p ≈ 2^{6λ}
— the same size as the random-curve variant, with a much cheaper keygen (no
LLL on End(E_A), no Deuring machinery) but a *different* key-recovery
assumption (hidden small-discriminant orientation plus a walk, not EndRing).

### 4.4 What is new relative to each neighbour

* vs **Séta**: masks (diagonal, sender-random) make the hint useless to
  Robert's generic attack; torsion requirement N > d√w instead of N > D²;
  no trapdoor-curve construction, random curve plus a short endomorphism.
* vs **SILBE**: diagonal instead of scalar masks removes the ω(N) ≥ 2λ
  constraint (13 013 → ≈ 772 bits), no F_p-rational E_0, no Frobenius; a
  shortest endomorphism of E_A replaces the degree-√p connecting isogeny,
  which also drops the lollipop degree from (d_A d_B)² to d²·p^{2/3}.
  Lost: SILBE's pk is *any* curve with no extra data; ours leaks an
  eigenbasis (§5.1).
* vs **FESTA/QFESTA/POKÉ**: pk carries no torsion images of a receiver
  isogeny from a known-End curve, so key recovery is an EndRing-type problem
  rather than CIST/C-POKE; no E_0 at encryption time at all.
* vs **CV §5.3**: the "backdoor" is now the honest receiver's secret, so the
  basis-hashing countermeasure does not apply.

## 5. Cryptanalysis checklist (what must be settled before anything is claimed)

### 5.1 Key recovery: "EndRing with an eigenbasis hint"
Problem: given (E_A, P, Q) with (P,Q) an eigenbasis of some θ ∈ End(E_A) of
norm w ≈ p^{2/3}, find θ (then End(E_A) follows at cost |disc|^{1/4} ≈ p^{1/6}
classically / subexponential quantumly via HLW 2023/1448).
Known approaches and their cost:
* Guess the eigenvalues modulo L' | 2^e with L'² > w, then Kani: ≈ L'² ≈ w ≈
  2^{4λ} guesses; no per-prime localisation because N is a 2-power and the
  (2,2)-chain fails only at the end (to be verified experimentally, §6).
* Cycle/MITM search for an endomorphism of norm ≈ w: √w ≈ 2^{2λ} classical,
  quantum claw w^{1/3} ≈ 2^{4λ/3}.
* The eigenlines ⟨P⟩, ⟨Q⟩ expose two horizontal 2-isogeny walks of length e
  in the Z[θ]-orientation (E_A/⟨2^k P⟩ are all Z[θ]-oriented). This is
  class-group information of length e ≪ h(Z[θ]) ≈ √w ≈ 2^{2λ}; the
  self-pairing attacks (Castryck et al. CRYPTO 2023, 2023/549) need m² | Δ'
  with m | N, excluded by choosing Δ' odd. Macula–Stange sesquilinear
  pairings (AC 2024) must be checked against the eigenbasis specifically.
* Distinguishing an eigenbasis of a norm-p^{2/3} endomorphism from a random
  basis: every basis is an eigenbasis of *some* endomorphism of norm
  O(p^{2/3} N^{4/3}) (CV §5.4), so the hidden quantity is only the *size*
  of the smallest diagonal endomorphism. State as a decisional assumption.

### 5.2 Message recovery: "eigen-CIST"
Given (E_A, P, Q, E_C, [a]φP, [b]φQ) with a, b random, find φ.
* Weil pairing leaks ab·d mod 2^e, so ≈ 2^{e−1} masks remain; the attacker
  needs correct masks on 2^{e'} with 2^{2e'} > d, cost ≈ 2^{e'} ≈ √d ≈ 2^λ.
  This is FESTA's CIST sizing (FESTA uses d of 257–260 bits at λ = 128).
* The exposed subgroups φ(⟨P⟩), φ(⟨Q⟩) (mask-independent) give SIDH-type
  4-tuples without torsion, believed hard; but these are *horizontal* in an
  unknown orientation and the attacker knows E_C/φ(⟨P⟩) ≅ pushforward of the
  oriented neighbour — check whether the Arpin–Castryck–Eriksen–Lorenzon–
  Vercauteren level-structure action (2024/1172) gives any lever.
* Level-structure reductions of De Feo–Fouotsa–Panny (2024/459, Cor. 12–13)
  must be re-run with the eigenbasis as the level structure.
* Leakage attacks on masks (Das–Invernizzi–Kutas–Meers PKC 2026, 2025/2075;
  fault attacks 2026/1944) apply as to FESTA; nonces must be fresh per
  ciphertext and derived from the seed.

### 5.3 Quantum
* Unstructured key recovery stays at p^{1/4}; the eigenbasis gives at best
  the §5.1 costs. Nothing here is a group action, so Kuperberg does not
  apply to the attacker (the orientation Z[θ] is hidden).
* If θ ever leaks (side channel on decaps), security drops to HLW's
  subexponential bound in |Δ'| ≈ p^{2/3}: this is the scheme's single point
  of failure and argues for constant-time Kani code and FO with implicit
  rejection from day one.

### 5.4 Correctness corner cases
* ψ' non-cyclic on E_C[3^f] (part of ker φ θ'-stable): handled by trying the
  cyclic order-d subgroups of ker ψ' ∩ E_C[3^f] and keeping the one whose
  codomain is E_A (prototype: observed in 1 of 8 trials at the 44-bit size,
  brute-force enumeration over (Z/d)² at toy size; Smith normal form at real
  size). Exact frequency not yet measured.
* Eigenvalues must satisfy μ ≢ ν mod 2 for the eigenlines to span E_A[2^e];
  guaranteed when Δ' is odd.
* The Mumford-coordinate splitting formulas have rare degenerate inputs; the
  prototype retries with a fresh basis of E_C[3^f] (seen ≈ 1 in 25 trials at
  toy sizes, cause not yet isolated).

## 6. Experiment protocol and status

All runs on public toy parameters; no security claims at toy sizes. Code and
logs: `research/eigen_seta_prototype_20261011/` (README there).

Status 2026-10-11: step 1 done for two special-key variants (CM(−7) curve, and
a hidden CM curve behind a secret 5^k-walk) with the single-chain regime; the
generic mixed-step (2,2)-chain evaluator needed for it is written. Step 3 done
at toy size for those variants: of 86 wrong but pairing-consistent guesses of
Δ' (including guesses agreeing with the truth on 3–13 low bits), 85 ran the
full chain and ended on a Jacobian, i.e. failed only at the final split, with
no early-abort signal; one random guess in the CM variant also split to
E_C × E_C, an artefact of the CM curve's many small endomorphisms (and a
warning for special-key variants). Step 2 (random curve) blocked on the
two-halves evaluation. Steps 4–6 not started.

1. **Correctness prototype (SageMath).** Toy p = 2^e·3^f·c − 1 with e ≈ 60,
   f ≈ 20. Use E_0 = j 1728 directly as E_A (End public is fine for
   correctness), θ = a short element of ⟨1, i, (i+π)/2, (1+iπ)/2⟩ with odd Δ'
   and −Δ' a square mod 2^e; eigenbasis; encaps with random diagonal masks;
   decaps via the dimension-2 (2^e, 2^e)-chain (reuse the FESTA-SageMath or
   Theta-Isogenies chain code) and the two-halves trick. Acceptance: decaps
   returns s for 1000 random seeds; measure the ψ-non-cyclic failure rate.
2. **Random-curve keygen.** Replace E_0 by a walked E_A with explicit O_A
   (SQIsign2D-West / "Deuring for the people" tooling); LLL for short θ;
   measure how many θ must be tried for conditions (i)+(ii) and the achieved
   w/p^{2/3} ratio. Acceptance: median w ≤ 4·p^{2/3}.
3. **Toy cryptanalysis of §5.1.** At e ≈ 40: brute-force eigenvalue guessing
   plus Kani, and record whether a wrong guess is detectable *before* the end
   of the chain (gluing/splitting pattern of intermediate varieties). If an
   early-abort signal exists the guessing cost drops from L'² toward e·4 and
   the design is dead; this is the most important single experiment.
4. **Toy cryptanalysis of §5.2.** Run the published Kani attack code against
   ciphertexts with (a) correct, (b) wrong masks; confirm failure mode is the
   final non-splitting only. Then the level-structure reductions.
5. **Parameter script.** Encode the constraints of §4.3 (MITM, N > d√w,
   p ≈ Nd, 2^e | p+1, 3^f | p+1, p^{1/3} and p^{1/4} margins) and emit
   (e, f, c) for λ ∈ {128, 192, 256}; compare bytes and chain lengths with
   FESTA, QFESTA, POKÉ, SILBE, FESTA-UPKE.
6. **Write-up target.** If 3 and 4 pass: define Eigen-EndRing and eigen-CIST
   formally, prove OW-CPA ⇐ eigen-CIST and key recovery ⇐ Eigen-EndRing,
   apply FO, and position against 2026/1431 Problem 7 (it would *not* solve
   Problem 7 — the ciphertext assumption is still a torsion-hint assumption —
   but it would be the first practical-size PKE whose key recovery is an
   EndRing variant with a leakage term rather than CIST/C-POKE).

## 7. Alternatives considered and why they are not the lead

* **Scalar-mask lollipop with a short secret endomorphism** (SILBE minus
  Frobenius): same ω(N) ≥ 2λ wall; p stays > 10 000 bits. Dropped.
* **Secret or partially published orientation + class group action** (large
  discriminant, PEGASIS-evaluable): the sender must act, so the action and
  hence Kuperberg are available to the attacker; OSIDH's fate. Dropped for
  the user's "EndRing-based" goal; kept as a benchmark.
* **Deuring Diffie–Hellman** (both parties know End of their own curve):
  no canonical function of (E_A, E_B) computable from either End alone is
  known; non-commutativity is exactly the obstruction. Research question,
  not a design.
* **Insufficient-torsion hints (N² < d) decodable with End**: no decoder and
  no impossibility result exists (surveys, §5 of the torsion-attack report).
  Genuinely open; a positive result here would be a new mechanism. Listed as
  the long-shot follow-up.
* **Suborder/IsERP-based trapdoors** (pSIDH-like): quantum-polynomial break.
  Excluded.
* **IBE from End(E)**: shown unrealisable or insecure (Ozbay Gurler–Struck
  SAC 2025, 2025/1726). Excluded.

## 8. Requirement status

| Requirement (from the request) | Status | Evidence / gap |
|---|---|---|
| Research the state of the art on EndRing-based encryption | complete (survey level) | Sections 1–2, sources below; ePrint PDFs were Cloudflare-blocked, mirrors used; items marked abstract-only in the agent reports were not re-verified from full text |
| Identify primitives/concepts to build on | complete | §3 decoding lemma (CV Lemma 3), Deuring tooling, dimension-2 Kani, FO |
| Devise a strategy for a novel scheme | complete as a design; prototyped at toy size for two special-key variants; **not analysed beyond §5** | §4–6; `research/eigen_seta_prototype_20261011/`; novelty claim rests on the four surveys finding no eigenbasis-trapdoor PKE; a dedicated search for the exact combination is still advisable before any write-up |
| Build the scheme (user request of 2026-10-11) | partial: KeyGen/Encaps/Decaps correct in all completed toy trials for the `cm` and `walk` variants; random-curve variant not implemented (needs two-halves Kani) | `results/correctness_runs.txt`; §4.3 "two halves" paragraph |
| Parameter/efficiency figures | derived estimates only | §4.3; no measurements exist |
| Security | **not established** | §5 checklist; experiment 3 run at toy size with no early-abort signal (§6) |
