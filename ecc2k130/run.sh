# A container has a finite life, so a real search is a loop: each pass runs for
# HOURS, is stopped with SIGTERM so the client checkpoints, and the next pass
# resumes from that checkpoint.  Resume only works when the shape matches -- the
# checkpoint header records curve, run id, worker count and batch -- so every
# pass here is launched from the same variables.  Change one between passes and
# the client will refuse the checkpoint and silently start over.
