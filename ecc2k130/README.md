# ECC2K-130 and ECC2K-95

The optional [packed CUDA backend](PACKED.md) has measured a **14.472716 billion
complete scalar walk iterations/s median** on RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell using
[native carryless multiplication](NATIVE-CARRYLESS.md) and the
[16-slot batch preset](BATCH-TUNING.md) with
[weighted prefixes and paired Frobenius](WEIGHTED-PREFIX.md), plus
[compact physical field storage](COMPACT-STATE.md).
The public command measured **13.898911 B/s** with DP34 collection. Its
matched comparison measured 14.403112 B/s benchmark and 13.929753 B/s
collection; that comparison establishes the code change's gain.
The
[polynomial-coordinate storage option](POLYNOMIAL-STATE.md) reduces basis
conversions and denominator-cache traffic while preserving checkpoint compatibility. Use `--packed`
with the benchmark/validation entry points; its reports retain the existing
format, while checkpoints have a separate backend version.

For the validated RTX PRO 6000 configuration, use `make bench-rtx-pro6000`
or `make audit-rtx-pro6000`. These Modal presets select the packed backend,
CUDA 13.3.1 and the measured arithmetic/storage settings. The controlled compact
comparison measured a 6.31% benchmark gain and 6.09% collection gain over
the previous weighted preset at the same logical population. A separate audit
of the updated public command passed. See
[RTX-PRO6000.md](RTX-PRO6000.md) for results and requirements.

[THROUGHPUT-CEILING.md](THROUGHPUT-CEILING.md) records historical
instruction-pipe and memory probes for the earlier software arithmetic.
The native carryless and batch comparisons above give the current complete
walk measurements; the current 26 B/s target remains unachieved.
[FPGA-CEILING.md](FPGA-CEILING.md) asks whether an FPGA escapes that bound,
measures the generated field circuits as 6-input lookup tables, and finds one
FPGA competitive with one GPU on speed, about 2x cheaper per solved instance
and about 5–10x better per watt.

For the 857.163 M it/s RTX PRO 6000 baseline, experimental multiplier/cache
controls, repeated benchmarks and profiling, see [TUNING.md](TUNING.md).
That guide supersedes the earlier bandwidth estimates and tuning prescriptions
below; historical measurements remain recorded here.

A GPU-oriented client for the Certicom binary-curve challenges: Pollard rho with
a Frobenius-based iteration function, bitsliced, with the field arithmetic
emitted by a code generator.

Two targets are configured:

* **ECC2K-130**, still open, `GF(2^131)`, about `2^60.9` iterations. Uses the
  permuted type-II optimal normal basis of Bailey et al.
* **ECC2K-95**, solved by Harley's group in 1998, `GF(2^97)`, about `2^44`
  iterations. `2*97+1 = 195` is composite so that field has no type-II optimal
  normal basis; this one runs on a polynomial-basis backend with the
  orbit-invariant weight taken through a single linear map into a normal basis,
  which is the arrangement Harley's own client used. Its answer is public, so a
  recovered logarithm can be checked rather than merely believed.

The whole arithmetic layer is produced by a code generator that verifies every
routine it emits against an independent model of the field. The same source
compiles for CUDA (32-bit lanes) and for the CPU (64-bit lanes), so the exact
code that would run on a GPU is what the test suite exercises.

## Status

| | |
|---|---|
| Field arithmetic, iteration function, solver | implemented and tested |
| End-to-end discrete logarithms | recovered on `GF(2^23)` and `GF(2^41)` |
| CPU client | measured, 12.6 M iterations/s per core |
| CUDA client | public-command median of 14.472716 B/s for complete packed walks on one RTX PRO 6000 |
| Modal integration | validate, benchmark, autotune, search, fan out |
| ECC2K-95 instance | parameters recovered and independently verified |

Initial development used host execution and CUDA compilation checks. The
packed backend now also has device arithmetic, complete client and checkpoint
validation on the RTX PRO 6000. The public Modal audit runs these checks before
timing complete walks; retained results and their limits are linked above.

## The problems

Solve `Q = [k]P` on the Koblitz curve `y^2 + xy = x^3 + 1`.

**ECC2K-130**, over `F_{2^131}`, `|E| = 4l`:

```
l = 680564733841876926932320129493409985129        (129-bit prime)
```

Expected work is `2^60.9` iterations, producing about `2^35.6` distinguished
points. Open since 1997.

**ECC2K-95**, over `F_{2^97} = F_2[t]/(t^97 + t^6 + 1)`, `|E| = 4l`:

```
l = 39614081257132074233778707191                  (95-bit prime)
XP = 08A84FB02034F7771DC940097   YP = 1D2F10A471D48A720F18F6339
XQ = 0E0BC08AC5818F303E2B05E90   YQ = 134C028FC3393124D673E6F8E
```

Expected work is `2^44` iterations; Harley's group measured 2.16e13 in 1998,
against the `1.79e13` this repository predicts from `sqrt(pi*l/(4m))`. The
parameters were recovered from Harley's surviving client source and are checked
by the generator every time it runs: both points lie on the curve, both have
order `l`, and the published answer

```
k = 37837308472231540269443981458
```

satisfies `[k]P = Q`. That makes it a real end-to-end test of the whole pipeline
at a scale of a few GPU-hours rather than a few GPU-centuries.

## Design

### Word width

One word operation advances `W` walks at once. The device uses 32-bit words,
and the host picks the widest it has: AVX-512 gives 512 lanes and, through
`vpternlogd`, the same single-instruction three-input logic that `LOP3.LUT`
gives on the GPU. The arithmetic source is identical for all three widths;
only `bitslice.h` changes.

### Two field backends

`fieldbs.h` implements the permuted type-II optimal normal basis, where squaring
is an index permutation and the orbit weight is immediate. It needs `2m+1`
prime, which holds for `m = 131` but not for `m = 97` or `m = 109`.

`fieldpb.h` implements a polynomial basis `F_2[z]/(F)` for the fields that have
no such basis. A multiplication is the same Karatsuba tree followed by reduction
modulo a trinomial, and squaring costs 51 instructions rather than nothing. The
weight, which has to stay invariant under Frobenius for the walk to run on
orbits, comes from one generated linear map into a normal basis; the generator
picks the sparsest normal element it finds and checks that squaring really does
rotate the resulting coordinates.

Which backend a curve uses is a property of its config, so the walk, the kernel,
the solver and the reference are all written once:

| | multiply | square | weight |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GF(2^131)` normal basis | 8859 | free | 268 |
| `GF(2^97)` polynomial basis | 5627 | 51 | 1716 |

### Field representation

An element is `m` words in the permuted type-II optimal normal basis
`gamma_i = zeta^i + zeta^-i`, `i = 1..m`, where `zeta` is a primitive 263rd root
of unity. Two properties drive the whole design:

* squaring is the index permutation `i -> fold(2i)`, so it costs nothing when
  loops are unrolled, and
* the Hamming weight is invariant under squaring and under negation, so the
  iteration function is well defined on orbits of size `2m` without ever
  computing a canonical representative inside the loop.

The generator models this field as the symmetric vectors over `Z/263` modulo the
all-ones vector, with multiplication as cyclic convolution. That is a complete
and obviously correct model of `GF(2^131)`, and it is what every generated
routine is checked against.

Multiplication follows Bernstein-Lange: convert both operands to the optimal
polynomial basis `{1, c, c^2, ...}` with `c = gamma_1`, multiply as polynomials,
convert the 261-coefficient product back. Both conversions are generated from
the substitution `c = z + 1/z`, which splits by parity as
`H(c) = Heven(c^2) + c * Hodd(c^2)`; since squaring is an index permutation this
gives an `O(K log K)` conversion instead of the `O(K*m)` of a dense matrix.

### Iteration function

```
R_{i+1} = sigma^j(R_i) + R_i,    j = 3 + ((HW(x_{R_i}) / 2) mod 8)
```

with a point distinguished when `HW(x) <= 34`. The `sigma^j` selection is
branch-free: three conditional squarings, each one `LOP3` per word, and `j` is
never materialised.

### Batching and memory traffic

Each thread owns `ECC_BATCH` slots; a slot is 32 walks in the bit lanes of one
word. An iteration is two passes: the first computes weights, the
distinguished-point test and the running product of the addition denominators;
the second does one field inversion for the whole batch and then the affine
additions.

Pass 2 recomputes `sigma^j(x)` and `sigma^j(y)` from three stored weight bits
instead of reading back stored denominators. That trades 786 instructions for
1048 bytes of traffic per slot, which is worth it here — see the memory
analysis below.

### Distinguished points and restarts

A walk that reports is restarted in place from `R = Q + sum c_i sigma^i(P)`,
with `c` a 128-bit string from a PRF of the walk seed, computed with the same
bitsliced arithmetic and merged into the finished lanes under a mask. No linear
combination of `P` and `Q` is tracked in the loop; the server recomputes both
walks from their seeds when two of them collide, which is what keeps the inner
loop free of conditional counter updates.

Reports are `(seed, endpoint)`. Collision resolution recomputes each walk
counting how often each `sigma^j + 1` was applied, giving
`endpoint = [mu](alpha_0 P + Q)` with `mu = prod_j (1 + s^j)^{n_j}`, matches the
two endpoints up to Frobenius and negation, and solves for `k`.

## Results

### Validation

`make test` runs 52 checks across `GF(2^23)`, `GF(2^41)`, `GF(2^83)` and
`GF(2^131)`; all pass.

* every generated routine is checked against the independent field model inside
  the generator, on 64 random inputs at a time, before it is written out;
* the bitsliced multiply, square, inverse, `sigma^7` and Hamming weight are
  differential-tested against the reference implementation, which shares no code
  with them;
* the iteration function commutes with Frobenius and with negation, weight is
  constant on an orbit, and subgroup x-coordinates have even weight;
* the bitsliced start point matches the reference, and the tracked scalar
  reproduces it;
* the collision solver recovers a planted discrete logarithm;
* the distinguished-point comparison is checked exhaustively over all weights
  and cutoffs;
* the challenge point converts out of the normal basis back to Certicom's
  published polynomial-basis hex, `05 1C99BFA6 F18DE467 C80C23B9 8C7994AA`.

Longer runs check the reporting path rather than the algebra. On `GF(2^83)`,
12.6 M iterations produced 172 distinguished points at a rate within 30% of the
predicted one, and 60 of them were recomputed from their seeds by the reference
implementation with no mismatch, including walks that had been restarted. On
the challenge curve itself, run with a deliberately loose cutoff of 34 -> 50 so
that points actually appear, 3.1 M iterations produced 12368 reports, 25 of
which were recomputed and matched exactly.

### ECC2K-95

The generator refuses to emit the curve unless the recovered parameters check
out: both points on the curve, both of order `l`, and the published answer
satisfying `[k]P = Q`. The validation suite repeats the last of those against
the reference implementation.

Cost, measured per iteration rather than guessed:

| | GF(2^131), normal basis | GF(2^97), polynomial basis |
|---|---|---|
| multiply | 8859 | 5627 |
| square | free | 51 |
| weight | 268 | 1716 |
| whole iteration | about 60000 | about 32000 |

So ECC2K-95 runs about 1.9x faster per iteration than ECC2K-130 and needs
`2^44` of them instead of `2^60.9`, which is the difference between GPU-hours
and GPU-centuries.

One operational point matters more than the arithmetic. The number of reported
points comes out at roughly four times the number of parallel walks, because
each walk only gets `total/walks` steps and the cutoff has to be loose enough
that it reports within them. Filling a large GPU with 50M walks would therefore
demand 200M reports; the Modal search sizes the walk count first and picks the
weight cutoff from it, defaulting to 4M walks and about 16M reports.

### End-to-end

`make break-small` recovers planted discrete logarithms through the complete
pipeline — bitsliced walk, distinguished points, store, collision, recomputation
with exponent tracking, linear algebra mod `l`, and verification that
`[k]P = Q`. On `GF(2^41)` (`l` is 39 bits, about `2^16.6` expected iterations)
each instance takes well under a second on four cores.

### Throughput

Measured on one core of a 2.1 GHz Xeon, `GF(2^131)`, median of five runs:

| word | lanes | batch | iterations/s | cycles/iteration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `uint64_t` | 64 | 16 | 4.42 M | 475 |
| AVX2 | 256 | 32 | 10.7 M | 196 |
| AVX-512 | 512 | 32 | 12.6 M | 167 |

Four threads reach 40 M iterations/s. For comparison, the 2009 hand-written
qhasm implementation reached 533 cycles/iteration on a Core 2 with 128-bit
vectors.

On Apple Silicon (M4 Pro, 10P+4E cores, `GF(2^131)`, 64-bit lanes, sustained,
`--steps 8192 --launches 8`):

| threads | BATCH=32 | BATCH=64 | BATCH=96 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4  |  ~10 M  |  ~10 M  |  ~10 M  |
| 8  |  ~19 M  |  ~19 M  |  ~19 M  |
| 14 |  ~33 M  |  ~34 M  |  ~34 M  |

The 64-bit lane path autovectorizes into NEON 64-bit pairs under `-O3`, which
is worth about 25% on this hardware. Throughput peaks near the DRAM ceiling
(roughly 270 GB/s on M4 Pro, 8 MB/iteration at 14 threads x BATCH=64). The
default `BATCH=32` is near-optimal; `OMP_PROC_BIND=close OMP_PLACES=cores`
recovers another ~5% on the host OpenMP runtime.

The batch size matters more than cache pressure would suggest: going from 4 to
32 walks per inversion is worth 60% because it drives the amortised inversion
from 25% of the multiplication budget down to 3%.

| Karatsuba leaf | 9 | 17 (default) | 33 |
|---|---|---|---|
| instructions per 131-bit multiply | 8859 | 8859 | 10701 |

### Device resources (offline, `ptxas` 12.9, no GPU)

For `sm_120` at `ECC_BATCH=16`, leaf 17:

| | walk kernel | reseed kernel |
|---|---|---|
| registers | 255 | 255 |
| stack frame | 16440 B | 15400 B |
| spill stores / loads | 5160 B / 7024 B | 1556 B / 1564 B |

`mulLeaf`, `multPrep`, `toOnb`, `hamming` and `sigmaJ` each compile with zero
spills. The remaining spills are in the Karatsuba glue and the kernel body,
which hold several 131-word intermediates at once. The per-thread stack frame
is the number to watch on real hardware: it is local memory, so occupancy
depends on how much of it stays in L1.

### Occupancy versus spilling

A block-size bound alone lets ptxas give every thread all 255 registers, which
caps an SM at about 256 threads. Asking for more resident blocks
(`MINBLOCKS`) buys warps by taking registers away:

| blocks/SM asked | registers | spill stores | spill loads | warps/SM |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 255 | 5436 | 7256 | 4 |
| 2 (default) | 255 | 5436 | 7256 | 8 |
| 4 | 128 | 7520 | 9648 | 16 |
| 6 | 80 | 9540 | 12096 | 24 |
| 8 | 64 | 10356 | 12960 | 32 |

Two is free: 128 threads at 255 registers each is 65280 of the 65536 an SM has,
so occupancy doubles without a single extra spill, and that is now the default.
Past that the trade is real and only a device can settle it, which is what
`autotune` sweeps.

## Findings that update the implementation guide

**LOP3 fusion is worth 1.65x, and it changes the Karatsuba tradeoff.** A
131-bit multiplication costs 14554 two-input bit operations but only 8859
instructions once `xor(xor(a,b),c)` and `xor(a, and(b,c))` are fused into single
three-input operations. Because the fused form charges nothing for the XOR that
accompanies an AND, *schoolbook leaves beat Karatsuba leaves*: recursing all the
way down costs 18819 bit operations and 14770 instructions, while stopping at a
schoolbook leaf costs more bit operations and fewer instructions. The guide's
§5.1 question — whether to re-evaluate Karatsuba depth — resolves toward
shallower recursion than the bit-operation count suggests.

**The conversions are not a problem.** Generated from the parity recursion and
fused, `multPrep` is 331 instructions and the double-size inverse conversion is
903, against 325 and 909 for the hand-designed chains in the papers. The
Hamming weight tree is 268 instructions against 654 bit operations, because a
full adder is two `LOP3`s.

**Code size, not arithmetic, is the wall — and it is avoidable.** Compiling the
batch with everything inlined produced 285,096 PTX instructions for one kernel;
`ptxas` had not finished register allocation after five minutes and 5 GB of
resident memory. Marking the multiplication, inversion, conversions, leaf,
weight tree and `sigma^j` as real subroutines and refusing to unroll the batch
loop brings this to 36,553 PTX lines, a 3.5 s front-end compile and a 2.4 s
`ptxas` run. This is the §9 toolchain risk, and it is entirely a consequence of
inlining policy: no reverse-engineered assembler is needed.

**Keep walk restarts out of the hot kernel.** Building a fresh start point
costs 128 point additions, and inlining that call chain into the walk kernel
cost 5.8 KB of per-thread stack frame (22264 down to 16440 bytes) for a path
taken roughly once in 2^25 iterations per lane. Reporting a point now only
marks its lane, and a separate kernel — launched between walk kernels, and
skipped entirely when nothing reported — revives marked lanes. On the CPU the
same change was worth about 15% of throughput.

**Every generated routine register-allocates cleanly.** For `sm_120`, `mulLeaf`,
`multPrep`, `toOnb`, `hamming` and `sigmaJ` all compile to zero spill stores and
zero spill loads. What spills is the Karatsuba glue inside `mul` and the kernel
body, which hold several 131-word intermediates at once.

**The bottleneck needs a device profile.** The former 98-byte state estimate
omitted one read. At batch 32 the common path requests about 114 bytes of
global field state per scalar iteration, excluding local arrays and spills.
The out-of-line arithmetic can add substantial local-memory traffic even when
an individual leaf has no register spills. Measure DRAM, L1/L2, load/store issue
pressure and stalls before concluding that DRAM bandwidth or arithmetic is the
limiting resource. See [TUNING.md](TUNING.md) for the access count and profiler
command.

## Running on Modal

`modal_app.py` builds the client into a CUDA image (a fat binary covering
Ampere through Blackwell) and exposes five entry points:

```
export ECC_GPU=RTX-PRO-6000
modal run modal_app.py::validate      # correctness, on the device
modal run modal_app.py::bench         # throughput
modal run modal_app.py::autotune      # sweep the build knobs on real hardware
modal run modal_app.py::search --hours 4
modal run modal_app.py::fanout --count 8 --hours 4
modal run modal_app.py::merge         # collisions across every run
```

The GPU comes from `ECC_GPU`, read when the file is imported and baked into the
function definitions, which works on every Modal version. Clients from 0.72
also accept `--gpu` on the entry points to override it per call.

`validate` runs the whole test suite on the GPU machine and then recovers
planted discrete logarithms with the CUDA engine itself, so a GPU run proves the
same thing the CPU run does. `autotune` rebuilds for the local compute
capability only and sweeps batch size, block size and Karatsuba leaf, writing
the ranking to a Modal Volume. `search` collects distinguished points into that
same volume, checkpointing its live walks alongside them, so a stopped run
resumes where it left off and several containers contribute to one corpus; each
gets its own run id, which keeps their seed spaces disjoint, and each loads its
siblings' corpora so a cross-container collision is caught as it happens.
`merge` scans the corpus for repeated hashes, which are the candidate
collisions.

`RTX-PRO-6000` is the interesting target: it is the GB202 part the guide
identifies as the best value for this workload, since none of a datacenter
GPU's tensor silicon is reachable from binary-field arithmetic.

The image builds a fat binary for sm_80 through sm_120 with nvcc, which takes
about three and a half minutes and is cached thereafter. `autotune` rebuilds
for the local compute capability alone, which takes seconds.

## Running it

`run.sh` wraps the Modal entry points. A container has a finite life, so a real
search is a loop: each pass runs for `HOURS`, is stopped with SIGTERM so the
client checkpoints, and the next pass resumes from that checkpoint.

```
./run.sh validate                      # prove the GPU engine before spending anything
./run.sh bench                         # throughput on the challenge curve
CURVE=97 HOURS=4 PASSES=6 ./run.sh search
COUNT=8 ./run.sh fanout                # the same across eight GPUs
./run.sh merge                         # find a collision and recover the logarithm
```

`merge` scans every corpus for a repeated orbit and, when it finds one, hands
the whole set back to the client with `--load` so the pair is rewalked from
its seeds and solved. A campaign that ended with a collision count and no `k`
would not have finished. That path needs no GPU -- rewalking two walks is
cheap -- and it is the one place the `--load-max` cap must be off, since the
colliding pair is exactly what a cap might drop.

`make rehearse` drives the whole shape on a curve that finishes in seconds:
several workers with disjoint seed spaces, one stopped and resumed from its
checkpoint, and a collision only the merge can see because no single worker
holds both halves. The useful budget is a narrow window -- too much work per
worker and one solves alone, exercising nothing -- so it tries several and
says which it used.

`CURVE=131` collects on ECC2K-130 itself. That run does not finish: 2^60.9
iterations is decades of GPU time, so treat it as collection, not as a solve.
Two things follow from a run that never ends, and both are handled rather than
left to bite:

* The distinguished-point cutoff cannot be sized against the whole expected run,
  or no walk ever reaches it. At the full-run choice for m=131 a four-hour pass
  on a fast GPU reports about **two hundred points in total**. The cutoff is
  therefore sized from the iterations the pass will actually do, measured by the
  bench it already runs, which puts it back at a few reports per walk -- roughly
  30M points and a gigabyte of corpus per pass. `DPW` overrides it.
* The corpus outgrows memory. Every pass reloads it to catch collisions in
  process, and a store entry costs far more than the 32 bytes it occupies on
  disk, so an uncapped reload is what eventually ends a long collection run.
  `LOADMAX` (default 50M points) caps it, newest file first. What that gives up
  is finding a collision in process; the corpus is still complete on disk and
  `./run.sh merge` still finds it there.

Every pass is launched from the same variables, because resume only works when
the shape matches: the checkpoint header records curve, run id, worker count and
batch, and changing one between passes makes the client refuse the checkpoint
and start over. Run `validate` first -- it recovers planted discrete logarithms
on the GPU itself, so a broken kernel fails in a minute rather than quietly
burning a day of credits.

The searcher reports every 60 seconds:

```
[1h04m] 842.1 M it/s  3.24T iters (18.412% of 2^44.0)  14.80M dp  14.79M distinct  corpus 473.6 MB  2h56m left
```

Rate, iterations against the expected total for the curve, points reported
against distinct orbits stored (the gap is walks that re-reported), corpus size
on disk and time left in the pass. Anything that is not a progress line -- a
collision, a verification failure, a checkpoint that could not be written -- is
printed as it happens.

## Searching the build space offline

`make autolab` sweeps leaf size, block size, batch and the occupancy target,
compiles each, and reports what it can see without a GPU: registers, spill
traffic, stack frame, instruction mix, and the occupancy that follows from them.
It needs no card, because ptxas is deterministic.

Two ways to get the PTX. With a CUDA toolkit installed it uses `nvcc -ptx` for
the target architecture directly. Without one it falls back to clang against a
CUDA include tree -- the same pip-supplied toolchain as `check-cuda` -- and,
because clang 18 will not emit sm_120, compiles for sm_90 and rewrites the PTX
header before ptxas sees it. That is sound for this kernel, which uses no
architecture-specific instructions, and unsound in general. There is also no
need to install anything locally:

```
modal run modal_app.py::autolab
```

runs it in a CPU container that already has nvcc, and caches its metrics in the
volume so a second run only compiles what the first one did not.

To do both halves in one call -- map the space on a CPU container, then measure
only the survivors on a card:

```
ECC_GPU=RTX-PRO-6000 modal run modal_app.py::campaign
```

The search does not walk a cross product. The metrics are separable, and
measurably so: across a full sweep the instruction and local-op counts moved
only with the leaf, while registers and spill moved only with threads and
`minBlocks` -- neither ever tracked the other axis. So it varies one axis at a
time around a base point, which takes the default sweep from 240 builds to 15
and is what makes a fully straight-line leaf, minutes of ptxas on its own,
affordable to include at all. `--cross` restores the full product, worth doing
whenever the kernel changes shape. It also drops a launch bound that cannot
bind: below about 257 total threads the allocator keeps its 255 registers and
every `minBlocks` compiles to the same binary.

The leaf is the axis that trades instructions against local memory, and the
offline proxy cannot settle it:

| leaf | instructions | local ops |
|---|---|---|
| 17 | 21525 (+3.6%) | 9178 (+29.7%) |
| 33 | 19814 (-4.7%) | 7708 (+8.9%) |
| 66 (shipped) | 20786 | 7076 |
| 131 (no recursion) | 24503 (+17.9%) | 5158 (-27.1%) |

A fully straight-line multiply removes the Karatsuba recursion, and with it a
quarter of the local-memory traffic, for eighteen percent more instructions.
Local memory is DRAM-backed and instructions are ALU, so those are not the same
currency -- which is exactly why both ends sit on the Pareto front and go to the
card rather than being ranked here.

One axis is deliberately absent. `ptxas --maxrregcount` was measured against
`__launch_bounds__` at 255, 168, 128, 80 and 64 registers and gave
byte-identical spill counts at every one -- it is the same lever under a
different name, not a second dimension, and the kernel always carries launch
bounds, which take precedence over the flag anyway.

It does not pick a winner, because the thing that decides one is wall-clock and
that is exactly what it cannot measure. What it produces is the Pareto front on
occupancy against instructions against traffic, and a ready-to-run `autotune`
command for those few configurations. Six builds measured on a real card beats
a hundred and forty-four.

The command names the front's rows, not the distinct values in them:

```
modal run modal_app.py::autotune --configs 0:8:256:4,0:8:256:3,0:8:64:1
```

Each entry is `leaf:batch:threads:minBlocks`. Crossing the values back out
would measure two or three times as many builds as the front has points, which
gives away the reason for searching offline in the first place.

The tension it maps is occupancy against spilling. Asking ptxas for more
resident blocks makes it use fewer registers per thread, and past a point it
buys them by spilling to local memory -- already the dominant cost in this
kernel. Where that trade turns is a curve; the optimum on the curve is not
something static analysis settles.

Treat its ranking as a shortlist and never as a result. It has been wrong once
already, and expensively: the first cost function divided work by resident
warps, on the standard assumption that occupancy hides latency, and so ranked
the occupancy ladder upside down. Measured on an RTX PRO 6000:

| threads/minBlocks | registers | warps/SM | spill | measured |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 128/2 | 255 | 8 | 12664 B | **607.2 M it/s** |
| 256/2 | 128 | 16 | 17168 B | 314.5 M it/s |
| 256/3 | 80 | 24 | 21636 B | 233.8 M it/s |
| 256/4 | 64 | 32 | 23444 B | 209.5 M it/s |

Four times the resident warps costs 2.9x the throughput, monotonically.
Occupancy does not hide latency here because every resident thread carries its
own multi-kilobyte spill frame: 8 warps to 32 takes the local-memory footprint
resident on an SM from 3.2 MB to 24 MB, far past any cache, so the added warps
compete for DRAM instead of covering for each other. The cost function now
multiplies by occupancy rather than dividing, and reproduces that ordering --
though not the size of the gaps. It is calibrated against four points on one
GPU with one kernel, and should be rechecked with `::autotune` whenever the
kernel's spill behaviour changes.

The practical consequence is that `THREADS=128, MINBLOCKS=2` is already at the
255-register ceiling and the occupancy axis is spent. What is left is the leaf,
the batch, and the multiplier's gate count.

Three things it took a wrong answer to get right, none of which failed loudly.

It counts the call closure of the walk kernel, not the entry function: the
multiplier is `__noinline__`, so an entry-only count reported the same
instruction total for every leaf size and was blind to the one knob most worth
turning. It counts statements rather than indented lines, because PTX writes a
call's arguments one per line, and counting those charges a build in proportion
to how many calls it makes -- again the thing being compared. And it collapses
builds that compiled to the same thing: occupancy here is register-limited -- an
SM has 65536 registers, so resident warps are 2048/registers and the block size
does not enter -- which means `__launch_bounds__` does not bind at all until
`minBlocks * threads` passes about 257. Below that every `minBlocks` produces an
identical binary, and a Pareto front that does not notice fills with copies of
one configuration.

All three are now pinned by a fixture test over a small hand-written PTX module,
run by `make check-cli`, so the extraction cannot drift back to plausible wrong
numbers unnoticed.

## Persistence

A rho search is long enough that a run will be interrupted -- a spot instance
goes away, a time budget expires, a container is recycled -- so nothing the
client computes is allowed to exist only in memory.

At any instant the walks in flight hold about a quarter of everything the run
has computed. A walk reports after roughly 1/theta steps and the cutoff is set
so a walk reports a few times within the steps it gets, which puts the mean
unreported prefix at a quarter of the run. Killing a client without warning
therefore throws away 25% of the work, and that fraction does not shrink as the
run gets longer.

Three things are saved.

**The corpus.** `--dp-file F` appends 32-byte records of (seed, canonical orbit
hash): fixed width, so a file can be counted with a stat, appended to by several
writers and truncated by a dying container without becoming unparseable. A
short trailing record is ignored rather than misread.

**Old points as live state.** `--load F` reads a corpus back into the store at
startup, so a collision between today's walk and one from last week is found the
moment the new point arrives, not by an offline merge. Reload collisions are
solved immediately. Paths are canonicalised and deduplicated, so naming the same
corpus twice costs nothing.

**The walks themselves.** `--checkpoint F` writes every live walk -- point,
seed and step counter -- every `--checkpoint-every` seconds (default 300) and
again on exit, to a temporary file that is then renamed, so an interrupted write
leaves the previous checkpoint intact rather than a half-written one. The header
records m, thread count, batch size, lane width and run id; a client that does
not match refuses the file without overwriting it. Packed checkpoints use a
separate version and about 60 bytes per walk; the default bitsliced layout is
about 49 bytes per walk.

`SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` stop the client between launches rather than killing it:
it finishes the launch in flight, drains the reports, checkpoints and exits 0.
The Modal driver signals rather than terminates for exactly this reason, waits
for the client to finish writing, and only then commits the volume, so the
snapshot contains the checkpoint just written rather than the one before it.

Resuming needs the same shape it saved, so pass the same curve, run id, worker
count, backend and build-time batch size; a mismatched existing checkpoint is
an error. Use a new checkpoint path or run ID to start a different configuration.

## Build

```
make generate     # regenerate the arithmetic headers (needs python3 only)
make cpu          # CPU client
make test         # validation suite
make break-small  # end-to-end discrete logarithms on the small curves
make bench        # throughput on the challenge curve
make gpu          # CUDA client (needs nvcc)
make check-cuda   # type-check host and device with clang, no GPU or nvcc needed
make ptx          # device compile + ptxas report, no GPU needed
make verilog      # emit the FPGA datapath from the same IR, no toolchain needed
make check-verilog # simulate the emitted RTL against the field model
```

Build-time knobs: `BATCH` (walks batched per inversion, default 32), `THREADS`
(CUDA block size), `MARCH` (host architecture; `native` picks the widest word),
and `--leaf` to the generator (Karatsuba leaf size).

```
./ecc2k130-cpu --curve 131 --bench
./ecc2k130-cpu --curve 41 --instance 3      # recover a planted discrete log
./ecc2k130 --curve 131 --dp-file dps.bin --checkpoint state.ck   # collect
```

### Building on macOS

`make cpu` defaults to `CXX=g++`, but on macOS that resolves to Apple's
clang, which has no `-fopenmp`. Use the Homebrew toolchain:

```
make cpu CXX="/opt/homebrew/bin/g++-16 -isysroot $(xcrun --show-sdk-path)"
```

The CUDA targets (`make gpu`, `make ptx`, `make check-cuda`) need a CUDA
toolchain, which is no longer published for macOS — see the Modal section
above for the supported path.

## Index calculus: SAT point decomposition

An experiment, not a second attack. Index calculus does not beat rho on a
curve anyone cares about, and nothing here changes that -- the growth measured
below is the reason. What was missing from the public record is a measured
curve for a Frobenius-reduced factor base on a Koblitz curve, and this produces
one. Needs `pip install python-sat pycryptosat`; `make test-decomp` checks it.

```
cd codegen && python3 indexcalc.py --m 11 --points 3 --weight 3 --trials 5
```

**Factor base.** The Koblitz saving is that factor base columns are Frobenius
orbits, so a run needs |F|/m relations rather than |F|. The usual construction
takes the points whose x lies in a Frobenius-stable subspace -- but in a normal
basis the Frobenius is a coordinate permutation, so a stable subspace is an
F_2[t]/(t^m-1) submodule, which is to say a binary cyclic code of length m. Its
available dimensions are the degrees of the divisors of t^m-1, and at m=131 and
m=163 two is primitive mod m, t^m-1 = (t-1)(irreducible), and **the only stable
subspaces are the trivial ones**. The construction is unavailable at exactly
the interesting sizes; m=127 (ord 7) and m=233 (ord 29) are the lucky cases.

So use `{P : HW(x(P)) <= w}` in the normal basis instead. Weight is invariant
under a coordinate permutation, so this is Frobenius stable for every m. It is
not a low-degree algebraic condition, so a Groebner descent cannot use it -- but
a solver that does not need linearity can, and a cardinality constraint costs
O(mw) clauses. It is also the predicate the walk kernel already computes.

**Decomposition.** Chain Semaev's third summation polynomial rather than
resolving the (k+1)-th, whose degree is 2^(k-1) per variable: introduce the
intermediate sums and constrain each link with `S_3(u,v,w) = (uv+uw+vw)^2 +
uvw + b`. Squaring is sigma^1, a permutation of coordinates, so the square
costs nothing -- in a polynomial basis it would be m^2 XORs per link.

**Encoding.** `Prog.emitCnf` is `Prog.emit` with clauses instead of C, so a
multiplication costs the generated Karatsuba circuit's bit operations rather
than the m^3 AND terms its definition would need: 15588 gates at m=131 against
2.2 million. The circuit is XOR-dominated, so XOR clauses go to the solver
natively. Applying sigma to a decomposition of R gives a decomposition of
sigma(R), and the relation it yields is lambda times the original, so there is
no Frobenius symmetry to break inside one instance -- what is breakable is the
k! orderings of the same multiset of points.

**Measured.** Median over solved instances, k=3 points, w=3, CryptoMiniSat:

| m | gates | orbits | median solve |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9  | 1587 | 7  | 0.11 s |
| 11 | 2311 | 9  | 2.64 s |
| 23 | 8029 | 52 | none finished; one instance ran 25 min without returning |

Roughly 2^2.3 per bit of field over that range. Three points is not a fit, and
the encoding has not been tuned, but the shape is already clear enough to say
what the instrument is for: finding where the curve bends, if it does.

## What is not done

* Throughput on real hardware is unmeasured. The client has now run on an
  RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (sm_120): the whole validation suite passes there and
  every planted discrete logarithm is recovered on the device itself, through
  both backends. What has not been measured is how fast it walks. `bench` is
  the number that settles that, and `autotune` decides the build knobs —
  including whether the register-budget leaf, which is chosen from static ptxas
  analysis and measures *worse* on the host, is right on a GPU. The §6 layout
  question — one thread per bitsliced multiply versus 32 threads cooperating —
  is likewise only partly answered: the register data says the leaf fits, but
  the 16 KB per-thread stack frame means occupancy needs measurement.
* The multiplier is optimal only within the Karatsuba family. Toom-3 over
  GF(2), which is where Bernstein's 11961-bit-operation chain comes from, is not
  implemented; a search over balanced and unbalanced Karatsuba splits and the
  guide's 128+3 decomposition found nothing better than 8859 instructions.
* No server. Corpora are files that can be reloaded and merged, but there is no
  UDP protocol, no hash-routed sharding, and no live multi-machine merging.
* The start-point PRF is a mixing function rather than AES. Any client that
  wants to interoperate with a different implementation must agree on it.
* Multi-GPU is not implemented: one process drives one device.
