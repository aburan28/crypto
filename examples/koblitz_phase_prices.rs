//! The two phases this thread has left unpriced, measured.
//!
//! `S` has been reported as a lower bound throughout, because factor-base
//! selection and the linear algebra were null rather than zero.  Under
//! AGENTS.md §8 that blocks an admissible whole-pipeline `S`: "All phases
//! must be priced and final scalar verified before admitting a full-DLP
//! S."  This measures both in the same unit as everything else.
//!
//! Neither phase counts group additions natively, so each needs its own
//! conversion, measured here on the same host and the same instance as
//! the thing it converts — never a factor carried over from another
//! field or another machine.
//!
//! **Selection** spends abscissa draws.  Each is a random `x`, a
//! quadratic solve to lift it to the curve, and on success a cofactor
//! multiplication; new representatives also walk a Frobenius orbit, and
//! the base is rebuilt from the representatives at intervals.  The draw
//! is the unit because it is what the loop repeats.
//!
//! **The linear algebra** spends modular multiply-adds: block Wiedemann
//! does `products` matrix-block products, each touching `core_nonzeros`
//! entries for each of `block_n` vectors.  That count comes straight
//! out of the run's own report, so only the per-operation conversion is
//! measured here.
//!
