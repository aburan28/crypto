//! Where selecting a factor base spends its 79.5 additions a point.
//!
//! Selection is 23.4% of the `n = 41` pipeline now that collection's
//! relation count is at its floor, and it costs 79.5 group-addition
//! equivalents for each of the 15,744 points it produces.  The algebra a
//! point *requires* is much less than that: half of one half-trace
//! quadratic solve, because an abscissa carries two points, plus half a
//! Frobenius step to place it in its orbit.  So before optimising
//! anything, this measures the floor and then decomposes the measured
//! cost against it.
//!
//! The floor is the lift that produces a point plus the single Frobenius
//! step that places it in its orbit, both unconverted. Note that a
//! half-trace solve yields *two* points, and that every figure here is
//! per point, so the lift term needs no halving -- the first version of
//! this halved it and the orbit step too, and understated the floor by a
//! factor of two.
//!
//! The boundary here is a **floor derived from the field operations
//! selection cannot skip**, measured on this host rather than counted by
//! hand: no implementation of this phase can beat the cost of lifting
//! the abscissae it needs. Anything above that floor is representation,
//! not mathematics, and representation is negotiable.
//!
//! The candidates for the gap, read off the code before measuring:
//!
//!   * `points_with_x_fast` does its arithmetic in single words and then
//!     calls `lower`, which allocates two `BigUint`s per point.
//!   * `finish_factor_base_domain` keys its point index on
//!     `(BigUint, BigUint)` via `point_key` — two allocations and a
//!     two-`BigUint` hash per insert, and again per lookup.
//!   * the orbit and signed-orbit walks each step with `kc.frobenius` on
//!     a `BigUint`-backed `BinaryPoint`, and look up `point_key` at every
//!     step, so a point is keyed about three times over.
//!
