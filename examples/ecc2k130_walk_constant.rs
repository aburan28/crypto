//! **The iteration constant of an ECC2K-130 walk, measured.**
//!
//! Parallel rho on classes of `⟨σ, −1⟩` expects `c · √(πN/2)` iterations,
//! `N = (ℓ − 1)/2n` classes, where `c` is the walk's own constant: how far
//! it falls short of a random mapping (`c = 1`).  The campaign's planning
//! figure `2^60.9` is `√(πN/2) = 2^60.81` times `1.069`, the first-order
//! penalty `1/√(1 − 1/r)` of an `r = 8` branch walk — assumed, not
//! measured.  This measures `c` for the two iteration functions in
//! `ecc2k130/` (`ecc2k130/WALK-CONSTANT.md` has the method and the numbers):
//!
//! - `sigma`: `R ← R + σʲ(R)`, `j = 3 + b` — the shipping walk;
//! - `table`: `R ← R + ε σᵏ(T_h)`, `h = b` — the table walk
//!   (`ecc2k130/ITERATION-FUNCTION.md` §4), built as the device builds it: the
//!   walk carries the point itself, the step's tag `(h, k, ε)` names the
//!   addend, and the tag-history rule of `ecc2k130/include/tablewalk.h`
//!   advances `h` past a step that would undo the last one or close a
//!   4-cycle with the three before it.  Only the frame differs: here `k` and
//!   `ε` come from the canonical representative of the class (least rotation
//!   of the normal-basis `x`, least `y` of `±`), where the device derives them
//!   from a phase and a pivot bit.  Both frames satisfy `k(σR) = k(R) + 1` and
//!   `ε(−R) = 1 − ε(R)`, which is all the walk's class structure and the
//!   cycle rule use.
//! - `adding`: the table walk with hundreds of uniform branches, a control
//!   whose constant is `≈ 1`.
//!
//! and three ways of choosing the branch `b`, all class-invariant:
//!
//! - `native`: `(HW(x)/2) mod H`, the weight of `x` in a normal basis, as the
//!   device does.  Its distribution depends on the degree — `HW/2` has a
//!   standard deviation of `√n/4` — so at the small degrees this can run it
//!   is *not* ECC2K-130's.
//! - `uniform`: a hash of the class, uniform over `H`.
//! - `ecc2k130`: a hash of the class mapped onto the exact branch
//!   probabilities `(HW/2) mod H` has at `n = 131` (`HW` binomial, even).
//!
//! The count is the one a campaign pays for: `W` walks from random starts,
//! stepped in turn, until one of them lands on a class any of them has
//! visited — found exactly with a set of canonical keys, so no
//! distinguished points, no launch granularity and no tail.  The number of
//! distinct classes visited by then has mean `1 + Q(N)` for a random mapping
//! (every new point is a fresh uniform one until the first repeat), and `c`
//! is the measured mean over that.  Many walks rather than one, because a
//! single walk's rho length is set by the cycle of the component it lands
//! in and does not average; and a fresh mapping per trial (the hash salt,
//! the table) so that trials average over mappings as well as starts.
//!
//! **Fruitless cycles.**  An additive walk can return to a point it left a
//! few steps ago with no collision at all: steps whose addends cancel in
//! pairs.  The cycle rule removes the 2- and 4-step ones; longer ones remain,
//! and a walk that enters one never reaches a distinguished point.  Such a
//! return is not a collision and is not counted as one: every table step
//! compares the new point with the walk's last `RECENT` points, and a return
//! whose tags cancel in pairs is recorded by its length, and the walk
//! restarts from a fresh point.  Returns come in two formal kinds, counted
//! apart: tags that cancel in pairs (6 steps and up get past the rule), and
//! steps whose addends sum to zero through Frobenius itself — `τ² + τ + 2 = 0`
//! makes `σ^{k+2}T + σ^{k+1}T + σ^kT + σ^kT = O`, four steps and no pair.
//! The per-step rates are reported beside the leading-order predictions
//! `4(Σp²)³/(2n)³` and `24Σp⁴/(2n)³` (the number of patterns the rule lets
//! through, times the chance each determined tag comes up: a pair's second
//! tag matches its first with probability `Σp²/2n`, and a relation's four
//! steps all share one branch); what a trapped
//! walk costs a campaign is priced in the note, not here.  An exact return
//! that is not formal is a genuine collision and is scored as one.
//!
//! The normal basis here is `FrobeniusCanon`'s, not the device's type-II
//! optimal one, so `native` picks different branches for a given point than
//! the device would; `ecc2k130/src/walkconstant.cpp` runs the device's own
//! walks for comparison.
//!
//! Usage:
//! `cargo run --release --example ecc2k130_walk_constant -- --n 41 --walk sigma --dist ecc2k130 --trials 10000`
//! (`--walks W`, default 16; `--branches H`, `--seed S`, `--threads K`; one
//! JSON line on stdout).  `--rule v2` (the default) is the device's cycle rule
//! as extended in `WALK-CONSTANT.md` §11; `--rule v1` is the one before it,
//! which `matrix-v2` ran under.  The `*_predicted` fields are always rule
//! v1's leading-order counts, so a `v2` row reads as what the extension
//! removed.  `--merge N` instead runs N merge trials: two walks meet at one
//! point carrying different pasts, and the tool counts how often the rule
//! parts them within 16 steps (a lost collision under distinguished
//! points).  `--fixed-mapping` draws the mapping once, from the
//! seed, and runs every trial on it: the constant of *one* mapping, which is
//! what a campaign pays, where the default averages over mappings.  The
//! `native` σ walk has only one mapping per degree whatever the flag says.
