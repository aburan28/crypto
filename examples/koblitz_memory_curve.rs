//! The machine's random-access cost against working-set size, which is
//! what a decomposition probe actually pays.
//!
//! A probe is one random read of the presence filter, and the filter is
//! quadratic in the factor base: 32 MB at 9760 points, 128 MB at 18544,
//! 512 MB at 36112. The descent measured 0.148, 0.214 and 0.249 µs a
//! probe across those three, an exponent of `|F|^0.40` that the cost
//! model does not have. If that exponent is just this curve, it is not a
//! property of the code at all, and it can be extrapolated honestly.
//!
//! Two numbers per size, because a probe sits between them:
//!   * dependent — a pointer chase, every load waiting on the last, so
//!     the full latency including any page-table walk;
//!   * independent — random gathers with no dependency between them, so
//!     what the memory system delivers when the CPU can overlap.
