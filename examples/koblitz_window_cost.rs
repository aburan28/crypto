//! What a windowed `m = 3` scan costs per summand, against the window.
//!
//! The collection-window round priced its scans with the constant
//! measured on the *full* scan — `witnesses_fast` over the whole base —
//! because that was the only scan shape measured.  A windowed scan is
//! not that shape: it pays the same per-target prologue over `w`
//! summands instead of `|F|` of them, so its cost per summand rises as
//! the window narrows, and pricing a 256-summand window at the full
//! scan's figure undercharges it.
//!
//! This measures the curve, so a windowed run can be charged at the
//! figure for the window it used.  A window at least as wide as the base
//! is the full scan and is the right-hand end of the same curve, which
//! is what makes the two comparable.
//!
//! The per-target cost has to be the one collection pays, which is one
//! addition to walk to the next probe.  A first version of this drew
//! each target with a scalar multiplication instead; that is about 59
//! chained additions, and dividing it over 256 summands rather than
//! 15,744 invented a fourfold window penalty out of the harness.  The
//! walk is not a detail of the measurement, it is the thing measured.
//!
