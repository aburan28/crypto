//! **What the `m = 4` arm actually pays per `(k, l)`.**
//!
//! `RESEARCH_KOBLITZ_INDEX_CALCULUS.md` names the `m = 4` arm as the
//! one place that still probes a folded table one target at a time,
//! and prices that at "the 265 rather than the 145".  That is the
//! smaller half of what the loop does one at a time.  Its inner step
//! is
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let rest = self.curve.add(target, self.curve.neg(pair));
//! self.pairs_for(rest, &mut pairs);
//! ```
//!
//! and `FastCurve::add` calls `Gf2::inv`, a Fermat inversion — `n − 1`
//! squarings and as many multiplications — where the `m = 3` arm's
//! `add_many` amortises one inversion over a whole block by
//! Montgomery's trick.  This prices the two against each other.
