//! **The base a memory budget affords, once the pair table is folded by
//! the signed Frobenius group.**
//!
//! Three representations of the same set of pair sums, each cheaper per
//! stored pair than the last and dearer per lookup:
//!
//! - the full table, sixteen bytes a pair, summands included;
//! - the compact table, about four and a half, summands recovered by one
//!   `|F|`-long scan on a hit;
//! - the folded table, the same four and a half but `2n` times fewer
//!   pairs, because the base is closed under `π` and negation and so the
//!   pair sums are too — paid for by canonicalising each looked-up
//!   point, which is `n − 1` squarings.
//!
//! Since the descent spends `2r/|F|²` probes, a table that stores `2n`
//! times fewer pairs affords a base `√(2n)` times wider and a descent
//! `2n` times shorter.  Whether that is a win is the ratio of `2n` to
//! what the canonicalisation adds to a probe, and both sides are
//! measured here rather than assumed.
