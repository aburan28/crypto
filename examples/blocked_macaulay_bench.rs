//!
//! The structure is that the systems are **multilinear** with respect
//! to the natural block partition — one block of `ℓ` per summand, one
//! of `n` per intermediate point of the chain — degree at most one in
//! each block, even though the total degree is 2 for `m = 2` and 3 once
//! the chain appears.  Squaring is `F_2`-linear in characteristic 2 and
//! `x₁x₂` is bilinear, which is where it comes from.
//!
//! A total-degree Macaulay matrix ignores that and spends most of its
//! columns on monomials of high degree inside one block — exactly the
//! monomials the structure says cannot help.  Bounding the degree *per
//! block* instead takes the column count from `C(v, ≤D)` to
//! `Π_i C(v_i, ≤d_i)`.
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo run --release --example blocked_macaulay_bench
//! ```
//!
//! ## What is measured, and why refutation
//!
//! **Refutation.**  A random target does not decompose, and rejection
//! is most of an attack's work; it is also the case the algebra is
//! supposed to win, in the words of the Koblitz note — *"It refutes.
//! …an answer exhaustive search cannot give in kind, only by exhausting
//! the space."*  A decomposable target has many roots and no reduction
//! pins a variable, so "did it decide" is not a question either engine
//! answers there without a search on top; the infeasibility certificate
//! is the clean, engine-neutral event.
//!
//! So: random `x_R`, both engines asked for the constant `1`, cost
//! compared in 64-bit word XORs — the same unit as `crossbred_bench`.
//! Targets where either engine fails to refute are excluded from the
//! ratio and counted in its own column rather than scored.
