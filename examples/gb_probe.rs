//! What would a full parametric Gröbner basis cost to build?
//!
//! `algebra_cache` has three layers. `Preprocessing` is the one on the
//! relation-search path and it is cheap -- see `preprocessing_cost.rs`, which
//! measures it. `Parameterized` was the other extreme: a cached Gröbner basis
//! of the template with the target bits as `n` extra Boolean variables, capped
//! at 16. That cache was removed after it was measured never to pay for itself
//! (see `polynomial_reuse.rs`); this probe still prices the basis it would have
//! stored, because the cost is the reason it went.
//!
//! **Run every point under an external `timeout`.** A point past the feasible
//! edge does not come back:
//!
//!     for pt in "3 2 2" "5 2 2" "5 3 2"; do
//!       timeout 45 cargo run --release --example gb_probe -- $pt
//!     done
//!
//! `b = 1` throughout: the Koblitz coefficient, and the case the engine left
//! unclosed before it paired basis elements with the field equations. Three
//! engines, one row each; a superseded figure moves, it does not vanish.
//! 4-core x86_64 container, rustc 1.94.1, release, one run per point:
//!
//!                     vars   2026-09-21   340a8379    this engine
//!     n=3 ell=2 m=2     7       49 ms      10.5 ms       12.8 ms
//!     n=5 ell=2 m=2     9     5340 ms      1174 ms       1347 ms
//!     n=5 ell=3 m=2    11     did not finish in 45 s, on every engine
//!     n=7 ell=2 m=2, n=5 ell=2 m=3, n=7 ell=3 m=2, n=9 ell=2 m=2
//!                             did not finish in 45 s (2026-09-21)
//!
//! Read the columns as three different computations, not one getting faster.
//! 2026-09-21 is the engine before the chain criterion (b8eca515), which
//! accounts for the 4.6x to 340a8379. Neither of those returned a Gröbner
//! basis here: at n=5 the 340a8379 output has 28 elements and is not closed.
//! This engine adds the field-equation pairs, finds two new generators at each
//! point, and returns the 16- and 23-element reduced bases. It costs +22% and
//! +15% over 340a8379 at those points, the price of a correct answer on a
//! system that needs the pairs. Scoped to these points on this machine;
//! nothing here is a claim about any attack's cost.
