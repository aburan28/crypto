//! Measure the fast baby-step / giant-step solver against the general one.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run --release --example bsgs_fast_bench
//! ```
//!
//! Two questions, kept apart because they have different answers:
//!
//! 1. **How much does the representation buy?**  Both
//!    [`crypto_lib::cryptanalysis::bsgs_fast`] and
//!    [`crypto_lib::cryptanalysis::ecdlp_variants::bsgs`] solve the same
//!    instance by the same algorithm, so running them on one curve with
//!    one target isolates `BigUint` + `HashMap` against one word and a
//!    flat table.  Reported as a wall-clock ratio over many repetitions,
//!    because at these sizes a single solve is shorter than the timer's
//!    noise.
//! 2. **What does a solve cost?**  In `S = operations / √width`, the unit
//!    the repository's ECDLP threads report in, so these rows sit in the
//!    same table as the GPU engine's and as Pollard rho's.  Wall-clock is
//!    a practicality note; operation counts are the metric, because they
//!    survive the hardware.
//!
//! The general solver is only run where it finishes in reasonable time.
//! Its cost is the same `√n` in operations -- the gap below is constant
//! factors, not exponents, and is reported as such.
