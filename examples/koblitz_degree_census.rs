//! Which Koblitz degrees this repository can attack, and with what `r`.
//!
//! Written because a degree sweep assumed `r ≈ 2^{n-2}` and was wrong.
//! On this family `n` does not determine the subgroup order: the
//! cofactor swings from 4 at `n = 41` to 57,284,756 at `n = 59`, so
//! `r` is not monotone in `n` and two neighbouring degrees can differ by
//! fourteen bits of group order.
//!
//! That matters for any measurement of the `m = 3` scan, because the
//! scan saturates once `C(|F| + 2, 3)` approaches `r` — every probe hits,
//! the never-stopping sink spends its time in the `O(|F|)` recovery a
//! hit pays, and the figure stops being a probing cost.  Choosing a base
//! size by degree rather than by `r` walks straight into that; choosing
//! it by `r` is what this table is for.
//!
//! Degrees absent from the output have no usable prime-order subgroup
//! recorded, which is why a sweep over "the odd primes" finds nothing at
//! 43 or 47.
