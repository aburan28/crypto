### Task picked

Priority thread 1: P-521 LLL NaN — the `gram_schmidt` function in
`src/cryptanalysis/lattice.rs` never had scaling; first run needed to
investigate, implement, and test the fix.

### Work done

- Audited `gram_schmidt` (lattice.rs:125) and `big_to_f64` (lattice.rs:150).
- Traced the NaN source: for a 521-bit curve, `n² ≈ 2^1042 > f64::MAX ≈ 2^1023`.
  `big_to_f64` called `to_f64().unwrap_or(0.0)` which returns `Inf` (not `None`),
  so the GS norm computation sums `Inf * Inf = Inf`, and `Inf / Inf = NaN`.
- Found a SECOND related bug: for secp256k1 (256-bit curve), `n ≈ 2^256`,
  `n^4 ≈ 2^1024 > f64::MAX`. The GS norm for `bstar[0]` is `||bstar[0]||² = n^4`,
  which also overflows → Inf → NaN for secp256k1 (but NOT for P-256, whose `n` is
  smaller by `~2^{192}`, putting `P-256.n^4` just under `f64::MAX`).
- Implemented `big_to_f64_scaled(x, scale_shift)`:
  - For small entries (`nbits + scale_shift ≤ 1020`): direct `to_f64() / 2^scale_shift`
  - For large entries: first integer-shift to bring into `f64` exponent range,
    then re-apply remaining exponent as float multiply; preserves small entries
    (e.g. `2^384` scaled by `2^542` → `2^{-158} ≈ 2.7×10^{-48}`, finite, not 0).
- Updated `gram_schmidt` to compute `scale_shift = max(0, max_bits - 500)` over
  all basis entries (target: `dim × entry² < 2^1023`), then call `big_to_f64_scaled`.
  The μ_{ij} coefficients are invariant to global scaling, so the result is exact.
- Ran full test suite:
  - `cargo test --lib cryptanalysis::lattice`: 9/9 pass
  - `cargo test --test curve_audit`: 5/5 pass
  - `cargo test --test lll_degeneracy_probe -- --nocapture` (head-to-head):
    secp256k1 3/3 RECOVERED (~663ms/seed); P-256 3/3 RECOVERED (~654ms/seed)

### Findings

**Critical**: The "secp256k1 LLL degeneracy" documented in `RESEARCH_LLL_GS_ANALYSIS.md`
was NOT a genuine lattice-theoretic phenomenon. It was a floating-point overflow bug:
secp256k1.n is close enough to 2^256 that `n^4` exceeds `f64::MAX`, corrupting GS
with Inf → NaN and producing false LLL divergence (cap hit). P-256 escaped only
because its `n` happens to be smaller by `~2^{192}` making P-256.n^4 just fit.

Numerical verification:
```
secp256k1: n ≈ 2^256 - 2^32,  n^4 = Inf  (overflow f64::MAX ≈ 2^1023.99)
P-256:     n ≈ 2^256 - 2^192, n^4 = 1.797e308 (just under f64::MAX)
P-521:     n ≈ 2^521,  n² ≈ 2^1042  (direct overflow, never fit in f64)
```

After fix (scale_shift = max_bits - 500 when max_bits > 500):
```
P-521 basis entry n² → n²/2^542 = 2^500   (finite, ~3.3×10^150)
P-521 basis entry 2^384 → 2^384/2^542 = 2^{-158}  (finite, ~2.7×10^{-48})
dot product of 10 scaled-P-521 entries: ~10^302 < f64::MAX ✓
```

**Full sweep results** (`probe_lll_sweep_by_bit_length`, 1 seed, 8 sigs, LLL):

| Curve | n_bits | k_bits | Old outcome | New outcome | New time |
|-------|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| secp192k1 | 192 | 144 | ✓ 389ms | ✓ RECOVERED | 325ms |
| secp224k1 | 224 | 168 | ✓ 617ms | ✓ RECOVERED | 615ms |
| **secp256k1** | 256 | 192 | ✗ cap 10019ms | ✓ RECOVERED | 657ms |
| P-256 | 256 | 192 | ✓ 710ms | ✓ RECOVERED | 686ms |
| brainpoolP256r1 | 256 | 192 | ✓ 714ms | ✓ RECOVERED | 671ms |
| **P-384** | 384 | 288 | ✗ cap 20392ms | ✓ RECOVERED | 2047ms |
| **brainpoolP384r1** | 384 | 288 | ✗ cap 20131ms | ✓ RECOVERED | 2042ms |
| **P-521** | 521 | 384 | ✗ cap (NaN) | ✗ no short vec | 126010ms |

P-521 now runs WITHOUT NaN and WITHOUT iteration cap (LLL terminates cleanly in 126s),
but does not recover the key. The error is "LLL did not produce a recoverable short
vector — try more signatures or increase bias". This is a **genuine** failure mode
distinct from the numerical bug: with m=8, k_bits=384, the LLL reduction at 521-bit
precision does not find the short vector.

### Revised interpretation of `RESEARCH_LLL_GS_ANALYSIS.md`

- **§5 hypothesis** (secp256k1 r_i distribution causing μ-oscillation): **refuted**.
  The secp256k1 vs P-256 discrepancy was entirely due to floating-point overflow.
- **Failure A** (secp256k1 at 256 bits): **resolved** — numerical bug, not lattice.
- **Failure B** (P-384/P-521 iteration cap): **P-384 resolved** (numerical), **P-521 partial**.
  P-521 NaN is fixed; P-521 now has a genuine LLL precision/convergence issue at 521 bits.
- The Gram-Schmidt analysis in §3 remains valid as a theoretical framework.
- Open Q for P-521: is the "no short vector" failure due to (a) insufficient bias m=8/k_bits=384,
  (b) f64 precision loss in 521-bit LLL steps, or (c) need for BKZ vs LLL?

See next git hash after this entry.

### Next step proposal

1. **P-521 genuine failure diagnosis** (priority 1, continued):
   Try `m=16, k_bits=384` (doubling signatures) to see if more samples help.
   Try BKZ-β instead of LLL for the P-521 probe.
   Both are one-line parameter changes in `probe_once()`.
2. **Update `RESEARCH_LLL_GS_ANALYSIS.md`**: revise the "two failure modes" narrative;
   replace with the numerical-overflow explanation (the §5/7 analysis is now obsolete).
3. **CHLRS Igusa formula** (priority 2): implement the `(E × E^t)/Γ_α` Igusa-Clebsch
   invariants in PARI.  Start from `secp256k1_cm_audit/igusa_clebsch.gp` which may
   already scaffold this.
4. **Howe sextic twists** (priority 3): quick PARI check on 15 pairs.
