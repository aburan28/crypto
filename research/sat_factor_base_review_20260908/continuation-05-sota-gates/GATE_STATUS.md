# Koblitz index-calculus SOTA gate status

Current through Stage 99, 2026-09-13. The machine-readable optimization chain
is `stage-99-optimization-chain-20260913/verification.json`; it safely replays
the Stage 94--98 hosted archives, including the current five-pair `n=53` panel.
Stage 89 remains the archived predecessor panel and current optimized
unknown-scalar run.

The campaign has target-independent algebraic factor bases; matched native-XOR,
WDSat, CryptoMiniSat, direct-MITM, GGMP, and signed-Frobenius-rho controls; a
balanced 160-instance PDP panel through `n=59`; public unknown-scalar end-to-end
runs at degrees 23, 31, 41, and 53; and same-target known-answer and
scalar-blind construction, rank, solve, and rho comparisons at `n=53`. It has not passed all seven gates and
does not establish a new state of the art.

| Gate | Status | Current evidence | Remaining requirement |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 1. Charge every stage and resource | **Partial overall** | The corrected Phase-B matrix charges 21,038.596137 core-seconds. Stage 89 retains the predecessor selected run, optimized unknown-scalar run, and their full build/science charges. Stage 92 retains the current CPU-0 series. Stage 99 adds five hosted archives with separately metered build, direct, rho, wall, core-second, RSS, setup, collection, query, validation, and output charges. The Stage 97 panel has 403.640389 available build+science core-seconds / 144.286567 sequential wall-seconds / 1,718,992,896 B maximum sampled tree RSS. | Licensed Magma process resources are absent. Preinstalled OS/toolchain acquisition remains an explicit exclusion. |
| 2. WDSat, CryptoMiniSat, Magma F4, MITM, GGMP | **Partial** | Native XOR SAT, WDSat, CryptoMiniSat, and direct MITM ran on the exact 160-input packet. Standard `n=31`/`n=41` and GGMP `n=31` are represented. The Stage-32 successor removes the two original WDSat buffer errors without rewriting Stage 26. | Execute all 160 Stage-22 Magma inputs on a licensed host under the frozen one-thread/no-retry contract, seal the return before truth scoring, and report F4 resources. |
| 3. Single-core, core-seconds, memory, conflicts, wall | **Partial because Magma is absent** | Every executed Phase-B arm retains wall, core-seconds, peak RSS, conflicts or operations, tree memory, and workflow wall. Stage 89 retains five current four-thread matched direct/rho process meters. Stage 92 pins parent and child to CPU 0 on the selected stack: direct 9.405716 wall / 6.868316 core-seconds / 863,047,680 B RSS versus rho 6.945058 wall, a 1.354303 wall and 1.340180 core loss. | Supply the same fields for licensed Magma F4. SAT conflicts remain inapplicable to the exact pair-support arm and are reported as null. |
| 4. Scale through `n=31`, `n=41`, and a larger PDP regime | **Satisfied for finite execution coverage** | Phase B covers `n=31`, GGMP `n=31`, `n=41`, and PDP-only `n=59`. Unknown-scalar end-to-end controls cover `n=31` and `n=41`. Stage 42 constructs, ranks, solves, and verifies an exact same-target known-answer `n=53` instance. | The evidence is finite and toy-sized; it is not an asymptotic scaling law. The `n=59` arm remains PDP-only. |
| 5. Unknown scalar with no constructed factor-base logs | **Satisfied for finite degrees 23, 31, 41, and 53** | Stage 89 archives the public hash-seed-53001 `n=53` target without constructing or supplying its scalar, derives all 94 factor-base logs from 95 verified relations, and has direct IC and rho independently recover `d=7892094459170` with `[d]G=Q`. The optimized direct is now 5.629163 seconds and 1.279112 times rho. | Repeat on independent n=53 public seeds and obtain unaffiliated replay; these are strengthening steps rather than prerequisites for the finite gate-5 execution. |
| 6. Full cost against automorphism-optimized Pollard rho | **Five online wins; predeclared median and full-build gates still false** | Stage 97 runs five separately metered pairs on one host and target. Ratios are 0.966973, 0.965841, 0.976473, 0.971259, and 0.969444: five wins with a 0.969444 median, above the predeclared `<0.95` threshold. Median direct is 4.964933 seconds versus 5.122293 rho. Fresh build plus median direct remains 19.207632 times rho, and direct core cost remains about 1.69 times rho. Stage 98 compact evidence reduces repeated-run wall by 1.20 percent and core cost by 2.72 percent while retaining relation hashes and all validation, but its host has a 1.457715 direct/rho ratio. | Reduce and reproduce the paired median below 0.95 under a fixed host protocol, refresh selected CPU-0 and unknown-scalar cells, and retain full-build accounting. The `n=41` online crossover still assumes precomputed logs. All improvements are finite constants, not exponent changes. |
| 7. Independent external reproduction and novelty review | **Missing** | Issue [#97](https://github.com/aburan28/crypto/issues/97) and [mtrimoska/EC-Index-Calculus-Benchmarks#1](https://github.com/mtrimoska/EC-Index-Calculus-Benchmarks/issues/1) now include the five-run selected panel, current-head source pin, unknown-scalar result, exact verifier boundary, and the `CONCUR` / `QUALIFIED` / `BREAKS` format. | An unaffiliated reviewer must return a sealed reproduction and source-pinned novelty/correctness assessment. Project-authored CI and replays do not satisfy independence. |

## Current Phase-B matrix

The corrected 480-row SAT view has 141 true positives, 120 true negatives, 219
inconclusive outcomes, no false classifications, and no solver errors. Standard
`n=31` and `n=41` resolve all 40 targets under all three SAT backends. The
`n=31` GGMP cell yields 2 native, 1 WDSat, and 18 CryptoMiniSat true positives;
the rest are inconclusive. All three SAT backends are inconclusive on the 40
`n=59` targets under their caps. Direct MITM classifies all 160 inputs: 80 true
positives and 80 true negatives.

| Backend | Core-seconds | Summed process wall | Peak RSS | Conflicts or operations |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| Native XOR SAT | 958.931674 | 1,278.114043 s | 140,333,056 B | 9,233,732 conflicts |
| WDSat, corrected view | 7,404.749336 | 9,524.938771 s | 24,252,416 B | 7,599,249 conflicts |
| CryptoMiniSat | 6,237.273520 | 8,137.581155 s | 122,703,872 B | 19,480,743 conflicts |
| Direct MITM | 759.710741 inclusive outer | 766.538655 s one-CPU elapsed | 85,479,424 B tree | 4,804,252 additions; 4,768,800 pair entries |

The original Stage-26 cells remain immutable. Stage 32 adds 426.718011 charged
core-seconds to turn the two `n=59` WDSat buffer assertions into clean
timeout-inconclusive terminals. The classifications do not change.

## Current n=41 and n=53 end-to-end results

Stage 39 fixes the `n=41` factor base algebraically as the two-torsion
saturation of the Frobenius union generated by masks `[1,2,4,8,16,32]`.
Construction uses zero target samples or discrete-log labels: 2,380 abscissae,
4,759 rational points, 60 signed orbits, and 29 projected columns.

It derives and certifies all 29 logs from 35 relations over 114,688 probes.
Five domain-separated public hash targets solve in 0.259641 seconds versus
0.909281 seconds for signed-Frobenius rho. Precomputation is 4.310245 seconds,
so the online ratio crosses while the amortized ratio remains 5.025825. The
four-core ABBA control reduces median precomputation to 2.010618 seconds and
complete five-target IC wall to 2.479844 seconds, while increasing median
process CPU by 28.7 percent.

Stage 68 retains the current point-defined `n=53` base with 9,964 points and 94
orbit columns, selected without scalar labels or target-subgroup enumeration.
Packed witnesses reduce the support table to 738,197,504 bytes. Rank-aware
collection reaches augmented rank 95 with exactly 95 relations, and ordered,
pipelined support expansion plus fixed/fused PCLMUL arithmetic preserves every
relation hash and group check. On the same public point
`Q=(2565091273463387,5885236316843894)`, fused direct takes 6.039837 wall
seconds / 11.269810 core-seconds / 1,051,987,968 B RSS versus 5.106080 seconds
for signed-Frobenius rho: a 1.182872 loss. Fresh build plus direct is 19.474746
times rho.

Stage 72 then retains the optimized unrelated public hash target. It constructs
no scalar, derives all factor-base logs from 95 relations, and has direct IC and
rho independently recover `7892094459170` with `[d]G=Q`. Unknown-scalar direct
takes 6.571510 seconds and remains 1.467611 times rho; fresh build plus direct
is 25.359925 times rho. The corrected Linux single-core receipt pins parent and
child to CPU 0: direct takes 10.945707 wall / 8.576129 core-seconds versus rho
5.490656 wall / 4.334277 core-seconds, a 1.993515 wall and 1.978676 CPU loss.

Stage 89 retains the post-optimization selected stack. It keeps generic initial
pair sums and generic Frobenius support expansion while selecting split Bloom
indices, insert-hash reuse, shared dual-sign denominators, 16-byte compact query
scratch, combined n=53 dispatch, and the exact direct-PCLMUL pair-query batch.
The specialized query batch improves collection by 17.66--19.31 percent across
three same-binary A/B runs while preserving every relation hash and counter.
Five selected-stack process ratios against the same signed-Frobenius rho target
are 0.946483, 1.019315, 1.094974, 0.932363, and 1.018776: two wins, three losses,
and a 1.018776 median loss. The current-head process reports 5.227982 wall
seconds / 9.193539 core-seconds / 1,053,990,912 B RSS versus 5.131633 seconds
rho. Fresh build plus direct remains 20.262764 times rho. The optimized public
unknown-scalar process takes 5.629163 seconds and remains 1.279112 times rho.

Stage 92 refreshes the forced-single-core comparison on that selected stack.
Linux affinity restricts both parent and child to CPU 0, and the direct arm uses
one query thread with the exact specialized pair batch. Direct takes 9.405716
wall seconds / 6.868316 core-seconds / 863,047,680 B RSS versus 6.945058 wall
seconds for rho: a 1.354303 wall and 1.340180 core loss. Fresh build plus direct
remains 14.691007 times rho.

Stage 99 archives the subsequent optimization chain. Direct low/high
coordinate windows replace the mixed Bloom hash; candidates that already pass
the filter skip a redundant second filter read; and an Itoh--Tsujii addition
chain reduces each degree-53 inversion from 105 field products to 59. The
matched Stage 94 arm reduces wall by 5.09 percent and core cost by 6.96 percent
with identical relation hashes. Stage 95 retains width 4096. Stage 96 rejects a
one-word blocked filter despite reducing exact misses by 69.27 percent because
its query and process wall regress. Stage 97 then records five online direct
wins, but its 0.969444 median misses the predeclared 0.95 gate. Stage 98 reduces
repeated evidence output by 98.13 percent and wall by 1.20 percent while
retaining the base hash, all relation hashes, and every mathematical and
reference validation. Host-to-host rho variation remains material.

The narrow supported conclusion is unchanged: this is strong internal
engineering and finite public toy-research evidence. The known SAT-based
point-decomposition and Frobenius-invariant-factor-base literature remain the
prior-art baseline. The finite `n=41` online descent is faster after
precomputation, and the current selected `n=53` panel wins all five online
cells, but its median does not meet the predeclared threshold and its core and
fresh-build costs remain above rho. Licensed Magma and unaffiliated
reproduction/novelty review remain open. This is not a new Koblitz
index-calculus SOTA result.
