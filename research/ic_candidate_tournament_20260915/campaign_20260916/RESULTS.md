# Continued IC tournament results

Batch parity verdict: **True**; selected implementation **combined_descent**.

Completed three new tournaments with **4,704 profiled trials**, each paired with a fresh native run. Every listed round passed its independent artifact/correctness audit. The 36-trial batch screen is separate development evidence.

## Interpretation

Every ratio uses a fresh matched rho run in the same round. The 16-target panel charges all setup once to the complete job and solves every target; it is separate from the single-target result. Rho uses the existing per-target solver API on the same constructed curve. Additional cross-target rho optimizations have not been measured here.

The parity rule was declared before measurement: both candidate/rho upper paired 95% limits and every curve-cell ratio must be at most 1.10, in instructions and native time, on confirmation and replay. The full decisions contain the replay evidence.

These are implementation improvements in fixed-compiler Valgrind amd64 guest instructions and matched native wall time. Kernel/device and external-audit work are outside the instruction count. No arithmetic-complexity, broader-family, or cryptographic-size claim follows. The K-instruction rank floor is deliberately weak.

The successful mechanisms are exact arithmetic substitutions, folded pair-table construction, smaller relation batches, and—where selected—cheaper descent initialization/checking. Every returned scalar still passes general worker verification and the independent Python checker.

## Reproduce and review

- [Complete winner source/configuration](WINNER.json) and [cumulative source patch](WINNER.patch).
- [Operation plan](PLAN.md), [single-target successor plan](ROUND4.md), and [batch plan](ROUND5.md).
- [Operating guide](../OPERATIONS.md) and [controller tests](controller-tests.json).
- [Arithmetic/table equivalence tests](preflight-next-tests.log) and [installed skill validation](skill-validation.json).
- [Retained failed build attempt](../runs/round-0003/prepare_failure.json); no measurements came from it.

Production library defaults were not changed. The frozen source, worker, configurations, raw profiles, receipts and replay evidence are retained under each linked round.
