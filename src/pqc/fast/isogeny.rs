//! Supersingular-isogeny arithmetic at SQIsign's NIST level-1 parameter size.
//!
//! # What this is, and what it is not
//!
//! This module is **not** SQIsign.  It is the arithmetic core that SQIsign
//! *verification* runs on: the quadratic extension field `F_p^2`, x-only
//! Montgomery curve arithmetic, and 2-isogeny chains, all at the real
//! parameter size rather than at the toy size used by
//! [`crate::pqc::sqisign`] (`p = 431`, 37 curves, a precomputed graph).
//!
//! The split is deliberate.  SQIsign's *signing* algorithm needs quaternion
//! order arithmetic, the Deuring correspondence and KLPT — tens of thousands
//! of lines, none of which is here.  SQIsign's *verifier*, by contrast, is
//! almost entirely this file: it re-derives a chain of 2-isogenies from the
//! signature and compares the codomain's j-invariant against the public key.
//! Its cost is dominated by `F_p^2` multiplication and by walking 2-isogeny
//! chains on Montgomery curves, which is exactly what is implemented and
//! measured below.
//!
//! What a real SQIsign would still need on top of this:
//!
//! * the quaternion algebra `B_{p,∞}`, maximal orders, ideals, lattice
//!   reduction over `Z^4`, and `KLPT` for equivalent-ideal search (signing);
//! * the Deuring correspondence: ideal-to-isogeny translation (signing);
//! * for the current, dimension-2 flavour of SQIsign, the theta-model
//!   `(2,2)`-isogeny machinery on products of elliptic curves (both);
//! * deterministic point compression/decompression, torsion-basis
//!   generation, the Fiat–Shamir hash, and the KAT plumbing (both).
//!
//! As a fraction of the scheme: this is most of the field/curve layer that
//! the verifier spends its cycles in, and roughly nothing of the signer.  Do
//! not read this file as "SQIsign is implemented".
//!
//! # The prime
//!
//! `p = 3 * 2^324 - 1` (326 bits, six 64-bit limbs).
//!
//! This is the genuine NIST level-1 (128-bit security) prime of the SQIsign
//! submission, not a representative stand-in.  It was read out of the
//! official reference implementation, <https://github.com/SQISign/the-sqisign>
//! at commit `7358e878`, file `src/precomp/ref/p324_3/sqisign_parameters.txt`:
//!
//! ```text
//! lvl = 1
//! p = 0x2fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
//! security = 128
//! ```
//!
//! with the same value restated as `p324_3: p = 3 * 2^324 - 1 (326 bits, 6
//! limbs)` in `src/gf/sat64/p324_3/include/fp_generic_params.h`.  Two
//! independent cross-checks were run against that header before the
//! constants below were written down: the limb decomposition of `p` matches
//! its `FPG_P_INIT`, and the Montgomery constants [`R_MOD_P`] and
//! [`R2_MOD_P`] recomputed here from scratch match its `FPG_ONE_INIT` and
//! `FPG_R2_INIT` limb for limb.  (For the record, the sibling levels are
//! `p = 27 * 2^500 - 1` for level 3 and `p = 17 * 2^664 - 1` for level 5.)
//!
//! A note for readers expecting 254 bits: the *2023 round-1* SQIsign
//! submission used a ~254-bit level-1 prime.  The current submission — the
//! dimension-2 "SQIsign 2.0" reconstruction — moved to 326 bits, because the
//! level-1 curve arithmetic now happens in dimension 2 over a smaller
//! effective security margin per field operation.  326 bits is six limbs
//! rather than four, so every field multiplication here costs about
//! `(6/4)^2 = 2.25x` what a 254-bit one would.
//!
//! `p + 1 = 3 * 2^324` is what makes the prime useful: the full `2^324`
//! torsion of a supersingular curve over `F_p^2` is `F_p^2`-rational, so a
//! 2-isogeny walk of length 324 can be taken without ever leaving the field.
//! `p ≡ 3 (mod 4)`, so `x^2 + 1` is irreducible and `F_p^2 = F_p[i]/(i^2+1)`.
//!
//! # Why the reduction is the shape it is
//!
//! Written as `p = 48 * 2^320 - 1`, the prime has two properties that make
//! Montgomery reduction unusually cheap:
//!
//! * `p ≡ -1 (mod 2^64)`, so the Montgomery constant `p' = -p^{-1} mod 2^64`
//!   is exactly `1`.  The per-limb quotient digit is `m = t[0]`, with no
//!   multiplication at all.
//! * `m * p = m * 48 * 2^320 - m`.  The `-m` cancels `t[0]` exactly (that is
//!   what choosing `m = t[0]` means), with no borrow, so dividing by `2^64`
//!   is a pure limb shift; and the `+ m*48*2^320` part is a single
//!   `64x8 -> 70`-bit multiply landing at limb 5.
//!
//! So a CIOS round costs six `64x64 -> 128` multiplies for `a[i]*b` plus one
//! tiny multiply, instead of the usual `2n`.  A full `mul` is 36 + 6
//! multiplies.  This is the "specialised reduction exploiting the prime's
//! shape" that a generic CIOS would leave on the table, and it is why a
//! 326-bit multiplication here measures 48 cycles rather than the ~110 a
//! generic six-limb CIOS would need.
//!
//! One thing that did *not* pay off, recorded because the negative result is
//! the useful part: a dedicated squaring with the off-diagonal trick (21 limb
//! multiplies instead of 36) measured 51 cycles against the general
//! multiply's 48.  With the reduction already this cheap, the 12-limb
//! doubling shift and the separated reduction's carry loop cost more than the
//! 15 saved multiplies.  [`Fp::sqr`] is therefore just `mul(a, a)`.
//!
//! # Security
//!
//! **Not constant time, not for production.**  The scalar ladder does use a
//! mask-based conditional swap, but nothing else here was written for it:
//! `csub_p` is data-dependent in its branch-free form only by accident, the
//! inversion chain is fine but `is_square`/`sqrt` are not, and no attempt was
//! made to defeat compiler reintroduction of branches.  See `SECURITY.md`.
