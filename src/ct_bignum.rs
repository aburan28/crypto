//! Fixed-width, constant-time(-by-construction) multi-precision integer.
//!
//! This module exists because `num-bigint`'s `BigUint` is the foundation
//! of every public-key operation in this crate, and it leaks via
//! operand magnitudes at the limb level — every key recovery attack
//! against ECDSA/ECDH/RSA in this codebase ultimately bottoms out on
//! that fact (see `SECURITY.md`).  A faithful fix means replacing
//! `num-bigint` with a fixed-width type whose every primitive runs in
//! the same number of cycles regardless of operand values.
//!
//! [`Uint<LIMBS>`] is a const-generic, four-or-more-limb little-endian
//! unsigned integer with branchless add/sub/mul, `subtle`-backed
//! conditional select/swap, and value-independent comparison.  ECC
//! curves use [`U256`] (= `Uint<4>`); the RSA private path will use
//! larger sizes (`Uint<32>`, `Uint<48>`, `Uint<64>` for 2048/3072/4096-
//! bit moduli).
//!
//! # What "constant-time" means here
//!
//! - **Operation count is value-independent.**  Loops always run their
//!   full bound; there is no early-exit on carry, borrow, leading
//!   zeros, or operand equality.  Some loop bounds depend on the outer
//!   loop counter `i` (e.g. the carry-propagation tail of Montgomery
//!   reduction), but `i` is a public loop counter whose value is not
//!   derived from any secret.
//! - **No data-dependent memory access.**  All limb indices are loop
//!   counters; no array is indexed by a value derived from a secret.
//! - **No data-dependent branch on Rust source.**  Conditional values
//!   route through `subtle::Choice` /
//!   `subtle::ConditionallySelectable`, which use volatile reads and
//!   `core::hint::black_box`-style barriers to prevent the compiler
//!   from re-introducing branches.
//!
//! What this **doesn't** guarantee, and never can at the language
//! layer: that the LLVM-generated machine code, on every target/CPU,
//! actually runs in the same number of cycles.  Some 64-bit
//! multiplications are variable-time on Cortex-A53, ARM7, and a few
//! older Intel chips; division is variable-time almost everywhere.
//! We only use `*` (which compiles to `mul`) and `+`/`-` (which never
//! vary), and we never divide.  See SECURITY.md for the full picture.

// ── Montgomery context + constant-time modular exponentiation ────────────

// wraps an odd modulus `n` together with the three precomputed values
// (`n_inv_low`, `R mod n`, `R² mod n`) that every Montgomery-form
// operation needs.  ECC fields can hard-code these in `const`s because
// `p` is fixed at compile time; RSA's modulus is generated at key-gen
// time, so the same setup work has to happen at runtime.
//
// Setup is *not* on a hot path — it runs once per loaded key — so we
// allow ourselves to lean on `BigUint` to compute `R mod n` and
// `R² mod n`.  Once setup is done, every subsequent operation goes
// through `Uint::mont_mul` / `Uint::mont_sqr`, which are limb-level
// constant-time.
//
// `mont_pow_ct` is the constant-time modular exponentiation that
// replaces `crate::utils::mod_pow_ct` on the RSA private path.  Like
// the existing helper, it processes a fixed number of bits per call —
