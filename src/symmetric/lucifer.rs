//! **Lucifer** — IBM's pre-DES block cipher.
//!
//! Lucifer is the direct ancestor of DES.  Designed at IBM's Yorktown
//! Research lab by **Horst Feistel** and refined by **Don Coppersmith**
//! and others in the early 1970s, it was the public-facing prototype
//! whose modifications under NSA review produced DES (FIPS 46, 1977).
//!
//! Several "Lucifer" variants exist in the literature.  The one
//! implemented here is the version described by **Arthur Sorkin** in
//! *Cryptologia* 8(1):22–42 (January 1984), which is the one most
//! widely cited in cryptanalysis textbooks (and which the FORTRAN/C
//! research code by Smith/LLNL implements).  It uses:
//!
//! - 128-bit block, 128-bit key, 16-round Feistel.
//! - Two fixed 4-bit S-boxes `S0`, `S1`.
//! - A fixed bit-permutation `o[]` and its inverse `pr[]`.
//! - A 128-bit shifting key register: each round consumes a 64-bit
//!   subkey for "key interruption" plus 8 "interchange-control bits"
//!   (the **ICBs**) that select, for each plaintext byte, which of the
//!   two S-box halves goes through `S0` and which through `S1`.
//!   After each round the key register rotates left by 56 bits.
//!
//! ## Security note
//!
//! **Lucifer is a historical artefact, not a serious cipher** — it is
//! shipped here strictly for pedagogy.  Ben-Aroya & Biham (1996)
//! recovered the full 128-bit key with `2^36` chosen-plaintext queries
//! using differential cryptanalysis, and several earlier attacks
//! reduce the effective key size well below brute force.  Even
//! ignoring that, the 56-bit key DES descendant is itself well past
//! retirement.
//!
//! ## Algorithmic conventions (Smith 1991 C reference)
//!
//! - The 128-bit block is held as 128 bits packed **LSB-first within
//!   each byte**.  That is, bit 0 of byte 0 of the input plaintext is
//!   the LSB of `plaintext[0]`.
//! - The block is split into two 64-bit halves; we call them
//!   `m[0..64]` (low half) and `m[64..128]` (high half).
//! - One round transforms the low half (the "active" half) using the
//!   high half (the "source" half), then conceptually swaps the halves.
//!   After 16 rounds the halves are swapped back so that decryption
//!   with the same algorithm using the inverse key schedule recovers
//!   the plaintext.
//!
//! For each byte `byte = 0..8` of the source half:
//!
//! 1. **Nibble split**: `hi = bits[0..4]`, `lo = bits[4..8]`.
//! 2. **S-box layer** controlled by ICB bit `K[8·tcbindex + byte]`:
//!
//!    ```text
//!        v = (1 − icb) · ( S0[lo] | (S1[hi] << 4) )
//!          + icb       · ( S0[hi] | (S1[lo] << 4) )
//!    ```
//!
//! 3. Write the 8 bits of `v` as `tr[0..8]` (LSB first).
//! 4. **Diffuse and key-mix**: for each bit `bit = 0..8`,
//!
//!    ```text
//!        target_byte = (o[bit] + byte) mod 8
//!        m_low[ 8·target_byte + bit ] ⊕= K[ 8·tcbcontrol + pr[bit] ]
//!                                          ⊕ tr[ pr[bit] ]
//!    ```
//!
//! where `o[] = {7,6,2,1,5,0,3,4}` and `pr[] = {2,5,4,0,3,1,7,6}` is
//! its inverse permutation.
//!
//! ## Key-schedule register (TCB control)
//!
//! `tcbcontrol` starts at `0` for encryption and `8` for decryption
//! (mod 16) and advances by one each byte processed.  After eight
//! bytes — i.e. one full round — the 16-byte ICB pointer has therefore
//! rotated by 8 (encryption) or 7 (decryption), which is exactly the
//! "rotate 56 bits left" of the spec's 128-bit shift register, since
//! each byte advance corresponds to a 8-bit logical rotation.
