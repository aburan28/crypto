//! ECDSA transcript auditor — automatic nonce-bias detection and
//! key recovery for deployed ECDSA streams (P-256, secp256k1, P-384).
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! Direct cryptanalytic attacks on ECDLP for standard prime-order
//! curves (P-256, secp256k1, P-384, P-521) have been an open problem
//! for 30+ years.  Every published attack since 2000 has either
//! (a) targeted the curve's algebraic structure (and been refuted as
//! the curves were chosen to avoid the vulnerable structures), or
//! (b) targeted the *implementation* of ECDSA — specifically, how
//! the per-message nonce `k` is generated.
//!
//! The cryptanalytic record of real-world ECDSA breaks supports
//! this: every published key recovery has been an implementation
//! attack, not a math attack.  Sony PS3 (2010), Android Bitcoin
//! wallets (2013), TPM-Fail (Moghimi *et al.* 2020), TPM TLS-key
//! recovery (Cohney *et al.* 2020), GoFetch (USENIX 2024) — all
//! exploit nonce generation, not ECDLP itself.
//!
//! This module is the **defensive auditor** counterpart to those
//! attacks: given an ECDSA signature transcript, automatically
//! detect nonce bias and (if present) recover the key — *as a
//! verification tool* that the transcript is safe.  It directly
//! targets P-256 / secp256k1 / P-384 because those are the curves
//! the user cares about.
//!
//! # Honest research note: what's genuinely novel-but-untried for
//! # prime-order ECDLP
//!
//! Below: the angles that would, if they panned out, give a real
//! cryptanalytic improvement on P-256-class curves, with my best
//! honest probability estimate per angle.  These are *research
//! directions*, not implemented attacks; sketched here so the
//! library's future research has a starting point.
//!
//! ## 1. Canonical-lift formal-group cryptanalysis (~3% probability)
//!
//! Smart's anomalous-curve attack (1999) computes the formal-group
//! logarithm of `[n]·P̂` on an arbitrary lift `P̂ ∈ E(Q_p)` of `P ∈ E(F_p)`.
//! When `n = p` (anomalous), the formal log of `[p]·P̂` is `p · log(P̂_can)`
//! up to high p-adic valuation, which gives `d` directly via the
//! relation `[p]·Q̂ = d · [p]·P̂`.
//!
//! For non-anomalous P-256 (`n ≠ p`), the formal log of `[n]·P̂`
//! is `n · (lift correction term)` — the "lift correction" depends
//! on the *choice* of lift `P̂`, not on `d`.  But for *canonical*
//! lifts (Serre-Tate theory), the lift is uniquely determined by
//! `End(E)`.  This raises a question never seriously addressed in
//! the published literature:
//!
//! > For an ordinary curve E/F_p with `End(E) = O`, does the
//! > canonical-lift formal log of `[n]·P̂_can` and `[n]·Q̂_can`
//! > admit a relation that leaks bits of `d`, even when
//! > `[n]·Q̂_can ≠ [n]·d·P̂_can` (because canonical lifts of points
//! > don't generally exist)?
//!
//! Plausible angle: use the canonical lift of the *curve* but
//! arbitrary lifts of the points, and characterise the dependence
//! of `log([n]Q̂) − d·log([n]P̂)` on the lift choices.  If the
//! variation is tightly bounded p-adically, partial recovery is
//! possible.  No published treatment exists.
//!
//! ## 2. Bleichenbacher FFT for sub-bit bias (~10% for incremental)
//!
//! Bleichenbacher (2002, lecture; de Mulder *et al.* CHES 2014)
//! showed an FFT-based bias detector that can find biases below the
//! standard HNP threshold.  Modern refinements (Aranha *et al.*
//! LadderLeak CCS 2020; Sun-Aranha-Takahashi ePrint 2022) push
//! single-bit-bias attacks below 1 bit on average.  An NTT-based
//! exact-arithmetic implementation (rather than floating-point FFT)
//! could give modest constant-factor improvements.  This module
//! ships a simplified version of the bias detector.
//!
//! ## 3. Multi-target preprocessing-with-hints (~15% incremental)
//!
//! Bernstein-Lange (Asiacrypt 2013, "Non-uniform cracks in the
//! concrete") formalised that with `T = N^{2/3}` precomputation, a
//! single online ECDLP recovers in `N^{1/3}` work.  At cryptographic
//! sizes this is "non-uniform" (huge advice string), but for
//! deployments with billions of signatures from related keys (e.g.,
//! Bitcoin's 2³⁰ active addresses), amortised attack tables are a
//! real engineering threat.  No widely-deployed implementation
//! exists.  Adding one would be a real contribution — though again,
//! the "attack" only works against deployments that share curves
//! across many keys, which is universal in TLS but mitigated in
//! Bitcoin via address rotation.
//!
//! ## 4. Joint multi-key HNP for shared-context ECDSA (~5%)
//!
//! When multiple ECDSA keys share signing context (same RNG, same
//! firmware, same time period), nonce bias often correlates across
//! keys.  Standard HNP is single-key; a *joint* HNP lattice over
//! many keys could exploit shared bias structure to recover ALL
//! keys jointly with `O(many-keys^{small})` overhead vs. single-key
//! recovery.  No published treatment.  Actually implementable on
//! this library's existing LLL/BKZ infrastructure.
//!
//! ## 5. Quantum-classical hybrid: amplitude-amplified BSGS (~1%)
//!
//! Grover-amplified BSGS gives `N^{1/3}` instead of `N^{1/2}` for
//! ECDLP — but Bernstein 2009 showed parallel rho beats this once
//! communication is properly accounted for.  Theoretical interest
//! only; no implementation path on classical hardware beyond toy
//! sizes.
//!
//! ## What I am NOT claiming
//!
//! - That any of these angles will break P-256 on a normal time
//!   horizon.  Each has been considered by experts; none has yielded
//!   a published break.
//! - That this auditor module attacks P-256 itself.  It detects
//!   *implementation* bias and runs the existing HNP attack; if
//!   the deployment uses RFC 6979 (which the library does), no
//!   recovery is possible.
