//! # Exhaustive isogeny-class search for an easier Gröbner presentation.
//!
//! **The question.** ECC2K-130 is the Koblitz curve
//! `K_0 : y² + xy = x³ + 1` over `F_{2^131}`.  Index calculus against it
//! goes through a *point-decomposition problem* solved by Gröbner basis,
//! and the cost of that solve is governed by the **solving degree** `D*`
//! (operationally, the first fall degree `D_ff`).  Isogenies move us to
//! a different curve `E'` in the same isogeny class, with the *same*
//! group order, so the ECDLP transfers.  Does some `E'` in that class
//! present a lower `D*`?
//!
//! ECC2K-130's isogeny class holds **exactly**
//! `H(Δ) = 38 531 015 900 842 054 149 ≈ 2^65.06` curves
//! ([`class_number::ecc2k130_class_size`]), so it cannot be enumerated —
//! and saying so precisely is part of the answer.  The module therefore
//! works on four levels, three measured and one derived:
//!
//! | level | scope | how |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | **E1** | *every* ordinary binary curve over `F_{2^n}`, both twists | [`sweep_all_curves`] — `2(2^n − 1)` curves, reached to `n = 9` |
//! | **E2** | the *entire isogeny class* of the ECC2K-130 analogue | [`sweep_isogeny_class`] — class extracted by [`IsogenyCensus`], reached to `n = 17` |
//! | **E3** | the `ℓ`-isogeny neighbourhood of ECC2K-130 itself at `n = 131` | [`walk_isogeny_ball`], [`ball::rational_isogeny_degrees`] — structural screens, since `D*` is unobservable there |
//! | **E4** | the `≈ 2^65` class members E1–E3 cannot touch | [`certify_leading_form_invariance`] — a machine-checked *derivation*, not a sample |
//!
//! E1 is a strict superset of E2, so a null result there settles the
//! isogeny question for every class over the field at once.
//!
//! ## The structural result E4 rests on
//!
//! The binary summation polynomial is
//!
//! ```text
//!     S₃(x₁, x₂, x₃) = (x₁+x₂)² x₃² + x₁x₂ x₃ + (x₁x₂)² + b,
//! ```
//!
//! and the curve enters it **only through `b`** (the `a`-dependence lives
//! in the Artin–Schreier side condition, not in the polynomial).  Since
//! `b = 1/j`, walking the isogeny graph *is* varying `b`; nothing else
//! about the presentation changes.
//!
//! Now Weil-restrict.  Writing `x_i = Σ_t u_{i,t} z^t` makes each `x_i`
//! **linear** in the Boolean unknowns, and squaring is `F_2`-linear in
//! characteristic 2, so
//!
//! - `(x₁+x₂)² x₃²` has coordinates **linear** in `u` (when `x₃` is the
//!   known target) or **bilinear** (when `x₃` is a chained unknown),
//! - `x₁x₂ x₃` has coordinates bilinear resp. trilinear,
//! - `(x₁x₂)²` has coordinates **bilinear**,
//! - `b` contributes its coordinate vector, and **nothing else**.
//!
//! Setting every unknown to zero leaves exactly `b`.  Therefore:
//!
//! > **Leading-form invariance.**  For a fixed target `x_R`, field,
//! > basis and decomposition size `m`, any two curves `E_b`, `E_{b'}`
//! > over `F_{2^n}` give point-decomposition systems whose
//! > positive-degree parts are **identical**; the systems differ by the
//! > constant vector `coords(b) + coords(b')` alone.
//!
//! `d_reg` in this literature is defined on the **homogeneous system
//! built from the generators' top-degree components**, so it is a
//! function of those components alone.  They are `b`-free, hence
//! **isogeny-invariant**, hence *every* curve in the isogeny class — all
//! `≈ 2^65` of them — has the same degree of regularity as ECC2K-130.
//! [`certify_leading_form_invariance`] checks the step mechanically at
//! each `n` rather than asking the reader to trust the derivation.
//!
//! Not claimed: that the two *affine* ideals have the same leading-form
//! ideal.  They need not — which is why `D_ff` is measured rather than
//! argued.
//!
//! What a constant *can* still move is the **affine tail**: a degree
//! fall whose remainder is a nonzero constant certifies infeasibility,
//! and which curves get that certificate is `b`-dependent.  So `D_ff`
//! is not forced to be constant by the theorem, only its leading-form
//! component is.  That residual freedom is exactly what E1 and E2
//! measure exhaustively.
//!
//! ## The second structural result: there is nowhere to walk *to*
//!
//! The only lever known to lower `D*` on these systems is **L1**,
//! subfield structure (`RESEARCH_DEGREE_REDUCTION.md` §2: Subfield mean
//! `D*` 2.04 vs Random 3.53).  A curve over `F_{2^n}` has that structure
//! iff it is `F_{2^n}`-isomorphic to one defined over a proper subfield,
//! which for ordinary curves means `j(E') ∈ F_{2^d}` for some `d | n`,
//! `d < n`.  With `n = 131` **prime**, the only proper subfield is `F_2`,
//! whose two elements give `j = 0` (supersingular — a different isogeny
//! class) and `j = 1`, i.e. `b = 1`, i.e. **ECC2K-130 itself**.
//!
//! So the subfield lever is not something an isogeny walk can reach: the
//! attacker already stands on the unique point of the class that has it,
//! and every isogeny step strictly loses structure.  [`subfield_members`]
//! enumerates the reachable subfield curves for any `n`, and the
//! `n = 131` answer is a set of size one.
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! - `D_ff` here is the operational first fall degree of
//!   [`crate::cryptanalysis::koblitz_groebner::first_fall_degree`], the
//!   same definition [`crate::cryptanalysis::ffd_harness`] uses, so the
//!   numbers are comparable with the FFD program's.
//!   [`cross_check_ffd_oracles`] verifies the two agree.
//! - The isogeny *walk* tracks `j`-invariants only; it does not build the
//!   explicit morphism `φ: E → E'` (see
//!   [`crate::cryptanalysis::binary_isogeny`] for why).  That is harmless
//!   here: the thread's conclusion is that no reachable `E'` is worth
//!   transporting a DLP to, so the transport map is never needed.
//! - `n ≤ 32` for the algebraic sweeps: the Boolean engine packs
//!   monomials into a `u64`, so the `2n`-variable full-field system caps
//!   there, and the Macaulay ranks cap it far lower in practice.
