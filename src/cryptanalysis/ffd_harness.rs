//! # First-fall-degree measurement harness for binary Semaev systems.
//!
//! Direct response to the "FFD is controversial / nobody understands
//! why some systems collapse" thread in the ECDLP research-direction
//! map.  This module *measures*, not *predicts*: it constructs the
//! Macaulay matrix of a binary-Semaev `S₃` system over `F_{2^n}` after
//! Weil descent into `n` quadratic polynomials over `F_2` in `2n`
//! bit-variables, then computes its rank at every degree `D = 2, 3,
//! 4, …` and reports the **fall degree** — the smallest `D` at which
//! the rank deficit exceeds the deficit predicted for a generic
//! degree-2 system of the same shape.
//!
//! # The FFD claim, in measurable form
//!
//! For a *generic* system of `n` quadratic polynomials in `v` Boolean
//! variables (with the field equations `xᵢ² + xᵢ = 0` thrown in to
//! force multilinearity), the **Hilbert series at degree D** counts
//! the dimension of `(F_2[x]/I)_{≤D}` and equals
//!
//! ```text
//!   H_gen(D)  =  Σ_{k=0..D} C(v, k)   −   n · Σ_{k=0..D-2} C(v, k)   (mod neg-terms)
//! ```
//!
//! with appropriate truncation when entries go negative.  The
//! Macaulay-matrix rank at degree `D` for the generic system is
//!
//! ```text
//!   rank_gen(D)  =  cols(D)  −  max(H_gen(D), 0).
//! ```
//!
//! The **first fall degree** is the smallest `D` at which the *actual*
//! rank of the Macaulay matrix is **strictly greater** than the
//! generic prediction by at least `1` — i.e. the ideal "fell": new
//! syzygies appeared that the generic count did not anticipate.
//!
//! The FFD conjecture (Huang–Kiltz–Petit, Crypto 2015) predicts the
//! FFD for Semaev systems is `O(log n)`; the Galbraith / Petit
//! pushback says experimental fall degrees grow much faster in
//! practice.  Both sides can read the table this module prints.
//!
//! # Pipeline
//!
//! Per `n ∈ {n_min, …, n_max}`:
//!
//! 1. Pick a random `b ∈ F_{2^n}` and a random target `x_3 ∈ F_{2^n}`.
//! 2. Form `S₃(X₁, X₂, x_3) = (X₁+X₂)² x_3² + X₁X₂ x_3 + (X₁X₂)² + b`.
//! 3. **Weil-descend**: write `X₁ = Σ_i a_i zⁱ`, `X₂ = Σ_i c_i zⁱ`
//!    with `a_i, c_i ∈ F_2`; expand `S₃` as an element of
//!    `F_2[a₀..a_{n-1}, c₀..c_{n-1}][z] / m(z)` and extract the `n`
//!    coefficients in `z⁰..z^{n-1}`.  Each is an `F_2`-polynomial of
//!    degree ≤ 2 in the `2n` bit-variables.
//! 4. Build the Macaulay matrix at degree `D` for each
//!    `D ∈ 2..=D_max`.
//! 5. Compute the rank over `F_2` (bit-packed row reduction).
//! 6. Compute the generic prediction `rank_gen(D)` from binomial
//!    coefficients.
//! 7. The fall degree is the smallest `D` with
//!    `rank(D) > rank_gen(D)` — i.e. the actual ideal is *more*
//!    constraining than the generic prediction, which only happens
//!    when hidden syzygies show up.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! - Field width capped at `n = 8` (matrix grows like `C(16, D) ≈ 1820`
//!   for `D = 4` already; `n = 9` already strains the row-reduction).
//! - Single-trial per `n`; for paper-grade FFD numbers you would
//!   average over many `(b, x_3)` choices.  The CLI flag for
//!   multi-trial sweeps is built in but defaulted to 1 to keep test
//!   time short.
//! - No "true Hilbert series" — we use the truncated generic count.
//!   For `D ≥ degrees-of-the-system`, the generic count can go
//!   negative and we clamp at zero, which slightly biases the FFD
//!   *upwards*.  In practice this still cleanly identifies the fall.
