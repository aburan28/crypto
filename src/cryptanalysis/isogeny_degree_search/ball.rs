//! # Level E3 — the `ℓ`-isogeny ball around ECC2K-130 itself.
//!
//! At `n = 131` the solving degree is unobservable: the Boolean system
//! has `262` unknowns and its Macaulay matrices are astronomically
//! larger than anything a study library ranks.  So this level does not
//! measure `D*`.  It walks the isogeny graph **exhaustively to a fixed
//! radius** and screens every curve it reaches against the *structural*
//! properties that are known to move `D*` — the properties
//! `RESEARCH_DEGREE_REDUCTION.md` §2 calls lever **L1**:
//!
//! | screen | what it would buy | what the walk finds |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `j ∈ F_{2^d}`, `d ⊊ 131` | the subfield/Koblitz factor base, `D*` 3.53 → 2.04 | only at the start point, and only because `131` is prime |
//! | GHS magic number `2 ≤ m ≤ 6` | Weil descent to a tractable genus | unreachable for *any* `b`: see [`achievable_magic_numbers`] |
//! | sparse `b` | smaller constant vector, nothing structural | the walk finds dense `b`, and sparsity is not a lever anyway |
//!
//! ## Why the magic-number screen is decided before the walk starts
//!
//! The GHS magic number of `E_{a,b}` over `F_{2^N}/F_2` is
//! `dim_{F_2} ⟨√b, √b², √b⁴, …⟩` — the dimension of the smallest
//! **Frobenius-invariant** `F_2`-subspace containing `√b`.  Those
//! subspaces are the `F_2[x]/(x^N − 1)`-submodules of `F_{2^N}`, so
//! their dimensions are exactly the **degrees of the divisors of
//! `x^N − 1` over `F_2`**, i.e. the subset sums of the cyclotomic coset
//! sizes.
//!
//! For `N = 131`: `131` is prime and `ord_{131}(2) = 130`, so `x^131 − 1`
//! factors as `(x + 1) · f` with `f` irreducible of degree `130`.  The
//! attainable dimensions are therefore
//!
//! ```text
//!     {0, 1, 130, 131}
//! ```
//!
//! and the useful GHS window `2 ≤ m ≤ 6` is **empty** — not for
//! ECC2K-130, not for any curve over `F_{2^131}`, isogenous or not.
//! [`achievable_magic_numbers`] computes this for any `N`, and
//! [`ghs_window_is_empty`] states the `131` case as a predicate.
//!
//! That is a statement about all `2^131` curves over the field, derived
//! rather than sampled, so it covers the part of the isogeny class no
//! walk of any radius can enumerate.
//!
//! ## The same divisor set closes the quasi-subfield route
//!
//! [`crate::cryptanalysis::quasi_subfield`] (see
//! `RESEARCH_QUASI_SUBFIELD.md`) reaches the ECDLP from the other
//! direction: it builds a factor base from the roots of a
//! quasi-subfield polynomial, which exist exactly where a
//! Frobenius-stable `F_2`-subspace does — i.e. exactly at the divisor
//! degrees of `t^n − 1`.  That is the **same** set
//! [`achievable_magic_numbers`] computes, so one calculation settles
//! both questions at `n = 131`:
//!
//! ```text
//!     attainable dimensions over F_{2^131}  =  {0, 1, 130, 131}
//!       → GHS window 2..=6            empty
//!       → n0 = 1    the subfield F_2, a factor base of 2 elements
//!       → n0 = 130  the trace hyperplane, a factor base of half the field
//! ```
//!
//! Neither surviving dimension is a usable factor base, so the two
//! known routes to a lower first fall degree on a binary curve are
//! closed over this field by one line of divisor arithmetic — and
//! closed for every curve, not just for ECC2K-130's isogeny class.
