//! The primal attack: embed the LWE instance in a lattice whose unique
//! shortest vector *is* the secret, then reduce until it falls out.
//!
//! This is the baseline both schemes' parameters were set against, and nothing
//! published has improved on it in years. If a claim about ML-KEM's or
//! ML-DSA's margin is interesting, it is almost always a claim about the *dual*
//! attack ([`super::dual`]) beating this one.
//!
//! # The embedding
//!
//! Given `b = A·s + e mod q` with `A` of shape `m × n`, Kannan's embedding (in
//! the Bai–Galbraith form, which scales the secret block so the short vector is
//! balanced) gives a lattice of dimension
//!
//! ```text
//! d = m + n + 1
//! ```
//!
//! containing `v = (e, ν·s, 1)` with `ν = σ_e/σ_s`, of volume `q^m · ν^n`.
//! `‖v‖ ≈ σ_e·√(m + n)`, which for the parameters here is far below the
//! Gaussian heuristic for the lattice — so `v` is *unique*, and the problem is
//! unique-SVP rather than SVP.
//!
//! The attacker chooses how many samples to use. Using fewer shrinks `d`
//! (cheaper reduction) but also shrinks the volume (less help from `q`), so
//! there is an optimum, and the estimators below search for it rather than
//! assuming `m` is all used.
//!
//! # Two conditions, deliberately both
//!
//! * [`primal_usvp_2016`] uses the closed-form condition of Alkim–Ducas–
//!   Pöppelmann–Schwabe: `√β·σ ≤ δ^{2β-d-1}·vol^{1/d}`. Cheap, and the one
//!   every published table is computed with.
//! * [`primal_usvp_simulated`] runs the BKZ simulator and applies the modern
//!   condition — the secret's projection onto the last `β` Gram–Schmidt
//!   directions must be shorter than `‖b*_{d-β}‖` — which respects the q-ary
//!   z-shape that the closed form ignores.
//!
//! They are independent predictions of the same number. A test asserts they
//! agree to within a few block sizes; where they do not, the simulated one is
//! the better-founded.
