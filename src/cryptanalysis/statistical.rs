//! Statistical distinguishers for cipher / hash output.
//!
//! These are the classic NIST-style randomness tests, scoped to the
//! cryptanalysis use-case: given a candidate cipher / hash / PRF, run
//! it on many varying inputs, concatenate the outputs into a bit
//! stream, and check whether the stream is statistically
//! distinguishable from uniform.  A failed test is strong evidence
//! the primitive is broken; a passed test is weak evidence it is
//! sound (lots of broken designs pass these).
//!
//! Three tests covered:
//!
//! 1. [`monobit_test`] — Frequency (monobit): equal counts of 0s and
//!    1s.  Fails any cipher with a constant or near-constant output
//!    bit.
//! 2. [`runs_test`] — Runs: number of runs of consecutive equal bits.
//!    Fails ciphers whose output bits are positively or negatively
//!    autocorrelated.
//! 3. [`chi_squared_byte_test`] — chi-squared over the byte
//!    distribution.  Fails ciphers with biased byte frequencies.
//!
//! All three return a small report struct including the p-value
//! (where well-defined) and a pass/fail decision at significance
//! level α = 0.01.

/// Report from [`chi_squared_byte_test`].
