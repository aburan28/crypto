//! # The degree a Weil-descent system actually reaches.
//!
//! Petit and Quisquater's Table 2 (*On Polynomial Systems Arising from
//! a Weil Descent*, ASIACRYPT 2012, p. 461) reports, for a handful of
//! `(curve family, n, n', m)` cells, the **average maximal degree
//! reached** in a Gröbner-basis computation, the average time and the
//! peak memory.  Its point is not the timings: it is that in every cell
//! the degree reached came out *below* the first-fall-degree bound,
//! because Semaev's polynomials are sparse and the bound is derived for
//! a generic system.  The bound used here is the semi-regular degree
//! of a boolean system with the same equation degrees, which plays the
//! same role: it is what a system with no exploitable structure would
//! reach.
//!
//! This module measures the same three quantities on the descent
//! systems this repository builds, so that the phenomenon can be
//! checked here rather than cited.
//!
//! ## What is and is not being reproduced
//!
//! **Not reproduced**: Petit–Quisquater's *numbers*.  Their Table 2
//! solves a symmetrised system in `mt + 1 = m² + 1` variables — five at
//! `m = 2`, ten at `m = 3` — obtained from the block structure of
//! Section 4 of that paper.  The symbolic descent
//! ([`pq_descent_symbolic`](crate::cryptanalysis::pq_descent_symbolic))
//! builds the plain descent, `m·n'` boolean variables with no
//! symmetrisation, so at `(n, n', m) = (11, 6, 2)` this module solves a
//! 12-variable system where they solve a 5-variable one.  The degrees
//! are therefore not comparable row by row and are not presented as
//! though they were.
//!
//! **Reproduced**: the *shape* of the measurement and the comparison
//! that gives it meaning — a derived degree bound in one column, the
//! degree actually reached beside it, and their ratio.
//!
//! ## What the columns mean
//!
//! | column | meaning |
//! |:--|:--|
//! | `family` | `K` for the Koblitz curve `y² + xy = x³ + a x² + 1`, `R` for a random binary curve of the same degree |
//! | `n` | the field degree: the system is over `F_{2^n}` and descends to `n` equations |
//! | `n'` | the `F_2`-dimension of the subspace `V ⊂ F_{2^n}` the summands are drawn from |
//! | `m` | summands: `m = 2` descends `S₃`, `m = 3` descends `S₄` |
//! | `vars` | `m · n'`, the boolean unknowns |
//! | `D_av` | mean over targets of the **solving degree**: the highest degree at which the run produced a new basis element |
//! | `D_max` | the largest solving degree over the targets |
//! | `D_pair` | mean highest degree of a pair *processed*, which Buchberger's strategy pushes above the solving degree |
//! | `D_sr` | the semi-regular degree of a system with the same equation degrees — the derived bound `D_av` is measured against |
//! | `ops` | monomial operations, the metric |
//! | `enumerate` | the reference in the same unit: evaluating every equation at every point of the subspace |
//! | `ops/enum` | above one means the Gröbner basis costs more than enumerating |
//! | `ms` | wall time, the practicality note |
//! | `KiB` | the engine's own peak footprint: monomials held × 8 bytes |
//!
//! ## This is a stage diagnostic
//!
//! `AGENTS.md` §2 is explicit that a number pricing one phase is never a
//! speed.  Everything here prices **one decomposition oracle call** on
//! one target.  It says nothing on its own about whether index calculus
//! beats rho; the whole-pipeline unit `S` and its boundaries live in
//! `ic_boundary` and the ledger note.  No row of this table may be
//! quoted as a speedup.
