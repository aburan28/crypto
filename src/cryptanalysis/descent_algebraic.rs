//! # Algebraic discriminator for `D*` — Hilbert-function / rank-profile defect.
//!
//! Workflow iterations 3–4 refuted every *incidence-graph* predictor of the
//! refutation degree `D*` (spectral expansion varies the wrong way;
//! treewidth is constant because the descended primal graph is the complete
//! graph). The lesson: the structure that makes a *subfield* factor base
//! easier (lower `D*`) lives in the **algebra of the coefficients**, not in
//! the variable-incidence graph. This module looks where the structure
//! actually is.
//!
//! ## The invariant
//!
//! For the `V`-substituted descended system `Σ`, build the Macaulay matrix
//! at each degree `D` and compare its rank `r(D)` to the **generic**
//! (semi-regular) prediction `r_gen(D)` for a system of the same shape
//! (`#eqs` quadratics in `#vars` Boolean variables). The **rank defect**
//!
//! ```text
//!   δ(D) = r_gen(D) − r(D)   ≥ 0
//! ```
//!
//! counts the **excess low-degree syzygies** the ideal carries beyond a
//! generic system — i.e. how far the Hilbert function falls below the
//! generic Hilbert series at degree `D`. A multiplicatively-closed factor
//! base (a subfield) injects many such relations early, so the hypothesis
//! (**prediction P3-alg**) is:
//!
//! > the structured / easy (low-`D*`) systems carry a **larger early rank
//! > defect** `δ(D)` at small `D` than generic/random systems — and that
//! > early defect is what predicts the lower `D*`.
//!
//! Unlike spectral γ and treewidth, `δ(D)` is computed from the *actual
//! coefficients* of the substituted system (via the same bit-packed
//! Macaulay rank the rest of the program uses), so it can see algebraic
//! structure a graph invariant cannot.
//!
//! ## What we expose
//!
//! - [`rank_profile`] — `(D, rows, cols, rank, generic_rank, defect)` per
//!   degree for an arbitrary `F_2`-quadratic system.
//! - [`early_defect`] — the cumulative defect `Σ_{D≤d} δ(D)` up to a cutoff,
//!   the scalar summary used for correlation against `D*`.
//!
//! ## References
//!
//! - Bardet–Faugère–Salvy, *complexity of Gröbner bases of semi-regular
//!   systems* (the generic Hilbert-series baseline `r_gen`).
//! - `RESEARCH_FFD_WORKFLOW.md` iterations 3–4 (the graph-invariant
//!   refutations that motivate going algebraic).
