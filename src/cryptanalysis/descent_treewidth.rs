//! # Descent primal-graph **treewidth** — the reformulated P2 predictor.
//!
//! Workflow iteration 3 (EXP-E, `descent_lowgamma`) **refuted** the spectral
//! form of the proof-complexity bridge: the structured *subfield* factor
//! base is the easiest case (lowest refutation degree `D*`) yet has *higher*
//! spectral expansion `γ`. So spectral `γ` does not explain solving-degree
//! ease. The driver's recommended reformulation is **treewidth** of the
//! constraint **primal (moral) graph**, for a sharp theoretical reason:
//!
//! - Gaussian / Gröbner elimination cost — and the Macaulay solving degree
//!   `D*` — is governed by **fill-in**, which is bounded by the treewidth of
//!   the primal graph (vertices = variables, clique per constraint). A
//!   *subfield* factor base induces **block structure** (the multiplication
//!   table of `F_{2^d}` couples variables in tight clusters), which gives
//!   **low treewidth** even when the spectral gap is large — exactly the
//!   regime that broke the spectral predictor.
//!
//! So the reformulated **prediction P2′** is: `D*` is positively monotone in
//! the **treewidth** `tw(G_primal)` of the `V`-substituted system, and in
//! particular the low-`D*` subfield case should be **low-treewidth**.
//!
//! ## What we compute
//!
//! - **Primal graph** of the descended system on a factor-base subspace `V`:
//!   one vertex per bit-variable, a clique on the variables of each equation
//!   ([`primal_graph`]).
//! - **Exact treewidth** via the Bodlaender–Fomin subset dynamic program
//!   over elimination orderings ([`exact_treewidth`]), `O(2^v · v²)`. Exact
//!   (not a heuristic) for `v ≤ 18` vertices — i.e. `n' ≤ 9`, which covers
//!   the whole regime the rest of the program runs in.
//!
