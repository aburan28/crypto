//! # The cost distribution of index calculus across a binary isogeny class
//!
//! The folklore is that the ECDLP costs the same everywhere in an isogeny
//! class, so an attacker gains nothing by walking to an isogenous curve
//! before solving.  [`crate::cryptanalysis::isogeny_class_search`] tests one
//! *component* of that claim — the affine refutation degree `D*` of the
//! descended Semaev system — over every curve at a small size.  This module
//! tests the claim **end to end**: it enumerates a real isogeny class, runs a
//! complete Gröbner-based index calculus on every member, and reports the
//! resulting cost distribution with a brute-forced DLP as ground truth.
//!
//! Three measurements per class member, all on the same curve and the same
//! factor-base subspace:
//!
//! 1. **Gröbner solve time** — wall-clock nanoseconds inside the
//!    decomposition solver, plus the reduction and node counts that explain
//!    it.  Time is reported alongside its own native counters precisely
//!    because wall clock is not portable evidence on its own.
//! 2. **Relation yield** — admitted relations per probe, and how many of
//!    them raised the rank of the relation matrix.
//! 3. **Observed first fall degree** — via
//!    [`crate::cryptanalysis::isogeny_class_search::measure_curve`], so this
//!    module reports the *same* operational first-fall definition the FFD
//!    harness was calibrated with rather than a lookalike.
//!
//! ## What "enumerate the class" can and cannot mean
//!
//! A vertex of the class is named here by **exhaustive trace scan**: every
//! `a₆ ≠ 0` over `F_{2^n}` is point-counted by the Artin–Schreier formula and
//! kept when its order matches the Koblitz order.  Every curve `y² + xy = x³
//! + a₂x² + a₆` has `j = 1/a₆`, so within one family `a₂ ∈ {0, 1}` the
//! coefficient `a₆` names the vertex uniquely.  The two families are
//! quadratic twists with traces `±t`, so they are *different* isogeny
//! classes of the same size, and [`preferred_family`] picks the one whose
//! Koblitz curve has a subgroup wide enough to host a DLP at all — at
//! `n = 17` the `a₂ = 0` curve has `#E = 2²·137·239` and cannot.
//!
//! The scan costs `O(4^n)` field operations, which is why this is a
//! small-`n` instrument.  It is nonetheless the **only** route to a named
//! class member available here, and that is a statement about the isogenies,
//! not about the scan:
//!
//! - the modular-polynomial walk needs `Φ_ℓ`, and
//!   [`crate::cryptanalysis::binary_isogeny`] tabulates only `ℓ ∈ {2, 3}`;
//! - the nontrivial isogeny degrees of a Koblitz class are the prime factors
//!   of the conductor of `Z[π]`, which are large and sparse — `271` at
//!   `n = 17`, `7193` at `n = 31`, `{409, 1721}` at `n = 41` — so `ℓ ∈
//!   {2, 3}` never moves;
//! - a Vélu step at those degrees needs the kernel polynomial as a factor of
//!   the `ℓ`-division polynomial, which is not implemented in this
//!   repository.
//!
//! [`ClassReachReport`] states that barrier per degree in one table rather
//! than leaving it implicit, so the sizes this module declines to run are
//! declined for a named, checkable reason.
//!
//! ## Scope, stated before any number is read
//!
//! **No isogeny is computed, so no point is transported.**  Each member gets
//! its own DLP instance `(G, Q = [d]G)` on its own curve.  What is measured
//! is therefore the cost of the ECDLP *on each vertex of the class*, which is
//! the quantity a cost distribution over the class is made of — but it is
//! not the cost of transporting one fixed instance along `φ`.  A claim about
//! the latter needs the isogeny, and this module does not have it.
//!
//! **The factor base is a vector subspace, not a Frobenius orbit.**  It has
//! to be: the Koblitz speedup comes from the `F_2`-Frobenius, which is an
//! endomorphism of `K₀` alone.  A curve isogenous to `K₀` over `F_{2^n}` does
//! not inherit it, so
//! [`crate::cryptanalysis::koblitz_index_calculus`] and its signed-orbit
//! unknowns do not apply to a class member at all.  Every member — the
//! Koblitz curve included — is therefore measured on the curve-agnostic
//! subspace base `V = ⟨1, z, …, z^{ℓ−1}⟩`, which is the only instrument that
//! can compare them.  The Koblitz curve's own Frobenius base is a separate
//! measurement and is not this one.
//!
//! **Every reported logarithm is verified twice**: once as `[d]G = Q` on the
//! curve, and once against an independent baby-step giant-step solve of the
//! same instance.  A disagreement fails the row closed
//! ([`IcCostRow::verified`]), and a failed row is reported, never dropped.
