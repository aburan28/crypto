//! # Where the curve coefficient sits in Semaev's summation polynomials.
//!
//! This module answers one question exactly, by symbolic computation rather
//! than by measurement: **does the curve coefficient `a₆` reach the leading
//! form of the Weil-descended `S_{m+1}` system?**  That is Boundary C of
//! `RESEARCH_ISOGENY_CLASS_SEARCH.md`, and it is what decides whether moving
//! along an isogeny class can change the degree of regularity at all.
//!
//! ## Boolean degree is a sum of Hamming weights
//!
//! The subtlety that makes this worth computing rather than estimating: after
//! Weil descent each `Xᵢ` is a vector of `F_2`-linear forms in its bits, and
//! `Xᵢ^{2^k}` is *also* `F_2`-linear (Frobenius is linear, and `b² = b` on
//! Boolean coefficients).  So `Xᵢ^e` is a product of `wt(e)` linear forms —
//! `wt` the Hamming weight — and a monomial `Π Xᵢ^{eᵢ}` descends to Boolean
//! degree
//!
//! ```text
//!   bdeg(Π Xᵢ^{eᵢ}) = Σᵢ wt(eᵢ)
//! ```
//!
//! not `Σᵢ eᵢ`.  Multiplying factor degrees therefore *overestimates*: in `S₄`
//! the product `(A₂B₁)(B₁C₂)` looks like degree `3 × 3 = 6`, but
//! `X₁X₂ · X₁X₂ = X₁²X₂²` collapses to Boolean degree 2, so the true figure is
//! lower.  The first write-up of this thread quoted `a₆` reaching degree `5` at
//! `m = 3` from exactly that product bound; the exact value computed here is
//! **4**.
//!
//! ## What comes out
//!
//! Building `S_{m+1}` by Semaev's resultant recursion
//! `S_{m+n−2} = Res_X(S_m(…, X), S_n(…, X))` and profiling it by `a₆`-power:
//!
//! ```text
//!   m   symbolic vars   top bdeg   max bdeg of a₆-carrying terms   gap
//!   2         2             2                  0                    2
//!   3         3             6                  4                    2
//!   4         4            12                 10                    2
//!   5         5            20                 18                    2
//! ```
//!
//! The top Boolean degree is `m(m−1)`, it is always `a₆`-free, and every
//! `a₆`-carrying term sits **exactly two** degrees below it.  So the
//! leading-form ideal of the descended system — hence its degree of
//! regularity, and the degree at which any top-degree cancellation first
//! becomes available — is independent of the curve for every `m` reached here.
//!
//! The gap being *constant* rather than shrinking is the part that matters: a
//! narrowing gap would predict the boundary failing at some larger `m`.
//!
//! ## The ceiling is `m(m−1)` for every `m`, and that part is proved
//!
//! Semaev's construction gives `deg_{Xᵢ} S_{m+1} = 2^{m−1}`, and over the
//! exponents `e ≤ 2^{m−1}` the Hamming weight peaks at `e = 2^{m−1} − 1`,
//! where `wt(e) = m−1`.  Since Boolean degree is `Σᵢ wt(eᵢ)` over the `m`
//! symbolic variables,
//!
//! ```text
//!   bdeg(S_{m+1}) ≤ m · max{ wt(e) : e ≤ 2^{m−1} } = m(m−1)   for all m.
//! ```
//!
//! What the computation adds is that this ceiling is *attained*, that the
//! monomials attaining it are `a₆`-free, and that `a₆` stops two short.  The
//! first two are what Boundary C needs, and **they are now proved for every
//! `m`** — see below.  The third, the gap being exactly `2` rather than at
//! least `1`, remains measured at `m ∈ {2,3,4,5}`.
//!
//! ## Boundary C, proved for all `m`
//!
//! Three steps.  The first two are cheap and reduce the boundary from a
//! search over every monomial of `S_{m+1}` to a single coefficient; the third
//! computes that coefficient in closed form, by induction.
//!
//! **1 — the ceiling shape is unique** ([`ceiling_shape_is_unique`]).  For
//! `m ≥ 3` the only exponent `e ≤ 2^{m−1}` with `wt(e) = m−1` is
//! `e = 2^{m−1}−1`: any smaller `e` has at most `m−1` bits, with equality only
//! when all are set, and `wt(2^{m−1}) = 1 < m−1`.  So a monomial reaches
//! `bdeg = m(m−1)` **iff** all `m` summand exponents equal `2^{m−1}−1`, and
//! Boundary C is decided by the single coefficient of
//! `Π_{i≤m} Xᵢ^{2^{m−1}−1}` — is it nonzero, and is it `a₆`-free?
//! (`m = 2` is exempt: there `wt(1) = wt(2) = 1`, so two shapes tie.)
//!
//! **2 — reverse at infinity** ([`reversed_semaev`]).  Substituting
//! `Xᵢ = 1/Zᵢ` and clearing by `Π Zᵢ^{D}`, `D = 2^{m−1}`, turns that
//! coefficient into the coefficient of `Z₁⋯Z_m`, so everything happens modulo
//! `(Zᵢ²)`.  The reversal commutes with the recursion — reversing `S_a` at
//! `2^{a−2}` and `S_b` at `2^{b−2}` puts `2^{a+b−4} = D` on each summand slot,
//! exactly the degree `S_{m+1}` needs — so the whole computation can be done
//! in the quotient, which is what makes `S₇` and `S₈` reachable when their
//! full expansions are not.
//!
//! **3 — the induction** ([`two_unreversed_closed_form`]).  For `S_n` with
//! `n−2` arguments reversed at `D = 2^{n−2}` and two left free,
//!
//! ```text
//!     S̃_n  ≡  (u+v)^D  +  uv·(u+v)^{D−2}·Q          (mod Zᵢ²),
//! ```
//!
//! `Q = Π Zᵢ`.  *Base* `n = 3`: direct, `S̃₃ = (u+v)² + uv·Z`.  *Step*: take
//! `n = a+b−2` with `a, b ≥ 3` and put `u` among `S_a`'s arguments, `v` among
//! `S_b`'s.  Each factor then has exactly two unreversed arguments — its own
//! free one and the resultant variable `Y` — so the hypothesis applies to
//! both.  Writing `ε = Q_A`, `δ = Q_B` (so `ε² = δ² = 0`, `εδ = Q`), each
//! factor **factorises**:
//!
//! ```text
//!     f = (Y+u)^{d_a−2}·[(Y+u)² + ε·uY],    g = (Y+v)^{d_b−2}·[(Y+v)² + δ·vY].
//! ```
//!
//! Resultants are multiplicative, and all four pieces are monic in `Y`.  With
//! `p = d_a−2`, `q = d_b−2` — both **even**, which is what makes
//! `(A + δB)^p = A^p` in characteristic 2 —
//!
//! ```text
//!     Res((Y+u)^p, (Y+v)^q)                     = (u+v)^{pq}
//!     Res((Y+u)^p, (Y+v)²+δvY)                  = (u+v)^{2p}
//!     Res((Y+u)²+εuY, (Y+v)^q)                  = (u+v)^{2q}
//!     Res((Y+u)²+εuY, (Y+v)²+δvY)               = (u+v)⁴ + εδ·uv·(u+v)²
//! ```
//!
//! the last from the characteristic-2 quadratic formula in
//! [`resultant_quadratics`].  Multiplying, and using
//! `pq + 2p + 2q + 4 = (p+2)(q+2) = d_a d_b = D`:
//!
//! ```text
//!     Res(f, g) = (u+v)^D + εδ·uv·(u+v)^{D−2},
//! ```
//!
//! which is the claim at `n`. ∎
//!
//! **Corollary — Boundary C.**  Reversing the last free argument `u` as well
//! (substitute `u = 1/Z_u`, multiply by `Z_u^D`) collapses the closed form to
//!
//! ```text
//!     S̃_{m+1}  ≡  1 + X_{m+1}·Z₁⋯Z_m           (mod Zᵢ²),
//! ```
//!
//! because `(1+vZ_u)^D = 1 + v^D Z_u^D ≡ 1` for `D` a power of two.  So the
//! coefficient of `Π_{i≤m} Xᵢ^{2^{m−1}−1}` is **exactly `X_{m+1}`** — nonzero,
//! `a₆`-free, and a single term.  With step 1 this says the Boolean-degree
//! ceiling `m(m−1)` is attained by exactly one monomial of `S_{m+1}`, namely
//! `X_{m+1}·Π_{i≤m} Xᵢ^{2^{m−1}−1}`, and that monomial carries no `a₆`.
//!
//! **Therefore the leading form of the descended Semaev system is
//! curve-independent for every `m`**, so `d_reg` is constant on every isogeny
//! class — Boundary C, for all `m`, not just the ones a machine can expand.
//!
//! The closed form is checked against the direct expansion at `n = 3, 4, 5`
//! and the corollary at `m = 2 … 7`; `m = 6` and `m = 7` are beyond what the
//! full expansion reaches and are the independent corroboration of the proof.
//!
//! ## Verification
//!
//! Each `S_{m+1}` is checked three ways before its profile is believed:
//! symmetry in all `m+1` arguments (checked on adjacent transpositions, which
//! generate the symmetric group), degree `2^{m−1}` in each argument, and — for
//! `S₄` — agreement with [`crate::cryptanalysis::binary_semaev::binary_semaev_s4`]
//! at random field points.  `S₅` was additionally checked against genuine
//! 5-point decompositions on four curves over `F_{2^5}`: it vanished on all
//! 1146 of them and on no tuple lacking a decomposition.
