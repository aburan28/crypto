//! Biclique cryptanalysis of full-round AES (Bogdanov, Khovratovich,
//! Rechberger — ASIACRYPT 2011).
//!
//! The biclique attack is the **only public attack that covers all
//! rounds of AES**. The gains are tiny — `2¹²⁶·¹` operations for
//! AES-128 (vs `2¹²⁸` brute force) — but the work-factor improvement
//! is provable, and the attack ushered in a wave of biclique-based
//! analysis on AES-like primitives (Whirlpool, SQUARE, Kuznyechik,
//! etc.).
//!
//! # The structure
//!
//! Pick an `d`-dimensional **biclique** at the end of the cipher:
//! a bipartite-graph-like structure where one side `{S_i}` and the
//! other side `{T_j}`, `i, j ∈ {0, …, 2^d - 1}`, are connected by
//! the cipher's last few rounds under specific **key
//! differentials**. Construct so:
//!
//! ```text
//! E_K[i,j]^{(last d rounds)}(S_i) = T_j   for all (i, j)
//! ```
//!
//! where `K[i, j] = K* ⊕ Δᵢ ⊕ ∇ⱼ` for a base key `K*` and two
//! commuting key-difference families `(Δᵢ)`, `(∇ⱼ)`. The biclique
//! covers `2^(2d)` keys with only ~`2 · 2^d` cipher evaluations.
//!
//! With the biclique in hand, the **outer attack** is a standard
//! Meet-in-the-Middle on the inner rounds:
//!
//! 1. Pick a plaintext `P`. Forward-compute `2^d` candidate inner
//!    states `(v_i = E_{K* ⊕ Δᵢ}^{(first n−d rounds)}(P))`.
//! 2. Backward-decrypt the biclique to get `2^d` candidate inner
//!    states `(w_j)`.
//! 3. For each `(i, j)` with `v_i = w_j`, the key candidate
//!    `K[i, j]` is consistent; verify with a second plaintext-
//!    ciphertext pair.
//!
//! Total work: `~2^(2d)` from the inner MITM, plus the biclique
//! construction. For AES-128, `d = 8` gives the published `2¹²⁶·¹`
//! work factor.
//!
//! # What this module provides
//!
//! Implementing a biclique on full AES end-to-end is roughly 2000
//! lines of careful bookkeeping; the original BKR paper takes 30
//! pages of dense protocol description to specify it. We don't ship
//! that. Instead this module provides:
//!
//! - [`construct_toy_biclique`] — build a 2-dimensional biclique on
//!   2-round small-scale AES `SR(2, 2, 2, 4)`, demonstrating the
//!   bipartite structure: starting from a base key `K*`, four key
//!   variants `K[i, j]` with `i, j ∈ {0, 1}` produce a 4-vertex
//!   bipartite graph whose edges are the cipher's last 2 rounds.
//! - [`verify_biclique`] — confirm that all `2^(2d)` edges of the
//!   biclique hold.
//! - Documentation of how the inner-rounds MITM is performed,
//!   referenced to the toy case.
//!
//! The toy biclique runs in milliseconds and lets the reader trace
//! the structure end-to-end.
