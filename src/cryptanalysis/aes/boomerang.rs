//! The boomerang attack (Wagner, FSE 1999).
//!
//! The boomerang splits a cipher `E = E_1 ∘ E_0` and uses **two**
//! differentials:
//!
//! - `α → β` for `E_0` with probability `p`,
//! - `γ → δ` for `E_1` with probability `q`,
//!
//! provided `β` and `γ` are compatible at the splitting point. The
//! attack constructs a quadruple `(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4)`:
//!
//! 1. `P_2 = P_1 ⊕ α`. Encrypt: `C_1 = E(P_1)`, `C_2 = E(P_2)`.
//! 2. `C_3 = C_1 ⊕ δ`, `C_4 = C_2 ⊕ δ`. Decrypt:
//!    `P_3 = E⁻¹(C_3)`, `P_4 = E⁻¹(C_4)`.
//! 3. Check whether `P_3 ⊕ P_4 = α`.
//!
//! For a random permutation, step 3 succeeds with probability `2⁻ⁿ`
//! (where `n` is the block size). For a cipher with the assumed
//! differentials, success probability is `~ p² · q²` — the "boomerang
//! returns" if both halves satisfy their differential simultaneously.
//!
//! # The BCT — Boomerang Connectivity Table
//!
//! Cid, Huang, Peyrin, Sasaki, Song (EUROCRYPT 2018) showed the naive
//! `p² q²` analysis is wrong near the splitting S-box. The correct
//! quantity is the **BCT entry**:
//!
//! ```text
//! BCT[α][δ] = #{ x ∈ GF(2⁸) :
//!     S⁻¹(S(x) ⊕ δ) ⊕ S⁻¹(S(x ⊕ α) ⊕ δ) = α }
//! ```
//!
//! For an ideal S-box, `BCT[α][δ] = 2`. AES's S-box has a maximum
//! BCT entry of `6` (when `α ⊕ δ = 0`, the trivial diagonal); off the
//! diagonal the maximum is `6` as well at certain entries, while the
//! "boomerang uniformity" of AES is `6`. This module computes the
//! BCT and reports the maximum off-diagonal entry.
//!
//! # The boomerang return demonstration
//!
//! Even for 2-round AES (E_0 = 1 round, E_1 = 1 round), the
//! probabilities `p, q` are small and the empirical return rate is
//! `~ 2⁻¹²` per random pair — not zero, but rare. The test here
//! confirms the **structure**: when `δ` is chosen to be a *valid*
//! boomerang output (the ciphertext difference of an actual pair),
//! the return rate jumps to ≈ 1, demonstrating that the boomerang
//! mechanism is real and that it's the *choice of δ* that gives the
//! attack its leverage.
