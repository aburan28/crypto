//! Mixture differentials (Grassi-Rechberger-Rønjom FSE 2016;
//! Bar-On, Dunkelman, Keller, Weizman CRYPTO 2018).
//!
//! A **mixture** of two plaintexts `P_a` and `P_b` is a quadruple
//! `(P_a, P_b, P_c, P_d)` where `P_c` and `P_d` are formed by swapping
//! a chosen subset `S` of byte positions between `P_a` and `P_b`:
//!
//! ```text
//! P_c[i] = if i ∈ S { P_a[i] } else { P_b[i] }
//! P_d[i] = if i ∈ S { P_b[i] } else { P_a[i] }
//! ```
//!
//! The defining algebraic property is `P_a ⊕ P_b ⊕ P_c ⊕ P_d = 0`.
//!
//! # The "trivial" preservation
//!
//! This XOR-sum identity is preserved by **every** AES operation,
//! because at every byte position the multiset of values across the
//! mixture is `{α, β, α, β}` for some `(α, β)`:
//!
//! - **SubBytes** is byte-wise, so the multiset becomes
//!   `{S(α), S(β), S(α), S(β)}` — still XORs to 0.
//! - **ShiftRows** just permutes byte positions.
//! - **MixColumns** is GF(2⁸)-linear; XOR-summing 4 inputs with sum
//!   0 gives output sum 0.
//! - **AddRoundKey** adds the same key to all four, cancelling out.
//!
//! Therefore `Enc(P_a) ⊕ Enc(P_b) ⊕ Enc(P_c) ⊕ Enc(P_d) = 0` after
//! **one round** of AES. The catch: MixColumns is linear and preserves
//! the XOR-sum identity, but the *byte-position multiset* `{α, β, α, β}`
//! that the next SubBytes layer relies on is destroyed by MixColumns
//! (each output byte is a linear combination of four inputs, so unless
//! the swap mask is column-uniform the output multiset is no longer
//! `{α, β, α, β}`).
//!
//! Concretely:
//!
//! - **1 round** (`nr = 1`, FIPS or with MC): identity holds.
//! - **2+ rounds**: round 2's SubBytes sees a non-`{α, β, α, β}` multiset
//!   and the identity breaks.
//!
//! Equivalently, defining pairwise differences
//! `Δ_xy = Enc(P_x) ⊕ Enc(P_y)`, the mixture forces
//! `Δ_ab = Δ_cd` and `Δ_ac = Δ_bd` after **one round**, and the
//! equality is generally lost after two.
//!
//! # What the actual mixture cryptanalysis exploits
//!
//! The cryptanalytic mixture attacks (Grassi 2016, BDKW 2018) use a
//! **stronger structural property** that's *not* algebraic-only:
//!
//! When the swap subset `S` is chosen so that `S` is a subset of one
//! column (e.g. byte positions `{0, 1, 2, 3}`), the four ciphertexts'
//! intermediate states at certain rounds live in a **subspace** of
//! the state. The intersection of two such "subspace trails" — one
//! from the plaintext side, one from the ciphertext side — gives a
//! distinguisher at 4 rounds that holds with probability ≈ 1 (vs
//! ≈ `2⁻³²` for a random permutation).
//!
//! This module implements the **algebraic foundation** (mixture
//! construction + pairwise-difference identity verification) plus a
//! **structural check** for the column-confined-swap case that's the
//! starting point of subspace-trail cryptanalysis. The full 4-round
//! subspace distinguisher requires ~`2³²` data and is described in
//! `DEFERRED.md`.
