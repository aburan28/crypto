//! The Square attack (Daemen, Knudsen, Rijmen — FSE 1997).
//!
//! The Square attack predates AES — it was designed for the cipher
//! **Square**, which became AES's structural ancestor. The attack
//! transfers directly, and it's the strongest known approach against
//! AES at very low round counts.
//!
//! # The Λ-set property
//!
//! Take 256 plaintexts that agree in 15 of their 16 bytes and have the
//! remaining byte take all 256 possible values exactly once. Call this
//! a **Λ-set** with one *active* byte. Track what happens to this set
//! through the AES round structure:
//!
//! - After round 1 (SubBytes → ShiftRows → MixColumns → AddRoundKey):
//!   the active byte has been mapped through the bijective S-box (still
//!   "all 256 values"), shifted into one row position by ShiftRows,
//!   then MixColumns turns that single active byte in a column into
//!   **four active bytes in one column**, each independently taking
//!   all 256 values.
//! - After round 2: ShiftRows distributes the four active bytes into
//!   four different columns; MixColumns then turns each of those
//!   single-active-byte columns into four-active-byte columns. The
//!   state is now **all 16 bytes active**, each ranging over all 256
//!   values across the Λ-set.
//! - After round 3: SubBytes is byte-wise so it preserves "all" sets,
//!   then ShiftRows shuffles them. MixColumns sums four "all" sets per
//!   column; the sum of `0,1,...,255` in GF(2⁸) is **zero**, so
//!   every output byte is **balanced** (XOR sum over the 256 ciphertexts
//!   equals zero). AddRoundKey XORs a constant, which preserves
//!   balance.
//!
//! This is the **3-round distinguisher**.
//!
//! # 4-round key recovery
//!
//! AES's final round drops MixColumns (FIPS 197). So peeling the
//! 4ᵗʰ round off costs only a guess of one byte of the last round key:
//!
//! 1. Encrypt a Λ-set under 4-round AES.
//! 2. For each byte position `(c, r)` of the ciphertext, guess
//!    `K₄[c][r]`.
//! 3. For each guess `k`, invert that final-round step at position
//!    `(c, r)`: undo AddRoundKey by XOR, undo SubBytes by `INV_SBOX`.
//!    (ShiftRows just relocates which post-round-3 byte we're looking
//!    at — `(c, r)` after ShiftRows came from `((c+r) mod 4, r)`
//!    before it.)
//! 4. XOR the resulting 256 bytes. If the sum is zero, `k` is a
//!    candidate for `K₄[c][r]`.
//!
//! The correct key produces sum = 0 by the 3-round distinguisher;
//! random keys produce sum = 0 with probability `2⁻⁸`. One Λ-set gives
//! ≈ 1 candidate per position; another Λ-set disambiguates. Once all
//! 16 bytes of `K₄` are recovered, invert the key schedule to get the
//! master key.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! 256 chosen plaintexts × 1 Λ-set, 16 byte positions × 256 guesses ×
//! 256 partial inversions ≈ 2²⁰ S-box lookups. Completes in
//! milliseconds; the test in this file proves it on a random key.
//!
//! # 5-round and beyond
//!
//! The attack extends to 5 rounds by adding one extra round at the
//! *start* (use a 2³² structure of plaintexts varying in one column,
//! find embedded Λ-sets after the first round) for ≈ 2³⁹ work, and to
//! 6 rounds by additionally guessing a column of the *first* round key
//! at the front. We do not implement those — they are well documented
//! and the structure is the same; what gets harder is bookkeeping, not
//! technique. Cross-referenced in `DEFERRED.md`.
