//! Impossible differential cryptanalysis (Biham, Biryukov, Shamir —
//! EUROCRYPT 1999). The "miss-in-the-middle" technique.
//!
//! The classical impossible differential for AES is:
//!
//! > Over **4 full rounds**, no plaintext-pair with input difference
//! > having exactly one active byte can produce an output difference
//! > with exactly one active byte.
//!
//! That is, the truncated differential `1 → 1` over 4 rounds has
//! probability **zero**, not just low.
//!
//! # Why it's impossible
//!
//! Track activity patterns through 4 rounds, starting with a single
//! active input byte at position `(0, 0)`:
//!
//! | Step    | Active bytes              | Reason                            |
//! |---------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
//! | input   | {(0,0)}                   | given                             |
//! | SB R1   | {(0,0)}                   | S-box preserves activity          |
//! | SR R1   | {(0,0)}                   | row 0 fixed                       |
//! | MC R1   | {(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3)} | branch number 5                   |
//! | AK R1   | same                      | XOR with constant                 |
//! | SB R2   | same                      | byte-wise                         |
//! | SR R2   | {(0,0),(3,1),(2,2),(1,3)} | rows 1, 2, 3 shifted              |
//! | MC R2   | all 16 active             | each column had 1 active ⇒ all 4  |
//! | …       | all 16                    | propagation only spreads          |
//! | output  | all 16                    | cannot collapse back              |
//!
//! Reading backwards from a single-active-byte output:
//!
//! | Step (reversed) | Active bytes              |
//! |-----------------|---------------------------|
//! | output          | {(0,0)}                   |
//! | INV AK R4       | {(0,0)}                   |
//! | INV SR R4       | {(0,0)}                   |
//! | INV MC R4       | column 0 fully active     |
//! | INV AK / SB R3  | same column-0 pattern     |
//! | INV SR R3       | one byte per column       |
//! | INV MC R3       | all 16 active             |
//!
//! The two views collide in the middle. Going *forward* the state is
//! all-active by round 2's MC; going *backward* the state is all-active
//! by round 3's INV_MC. There is no state pattern that both views
//! agree on, so the differential is impossible.
//!
//! # Distinguisher (this module)
//!
//! We implement the **distinguisher** at 4 rounds: across many
//! plaintext pairs with single-active-byte input difference, **zero**
//! pairs produce single-active-byte output difference. A random
//! permutation would produce such a pair with vanishing but nonzero
//! probability, so the gap is in principle detectable; in practice,
//! the empirical "0 vs 0" result on a finite test is the educational
//! point.
//!
//! # 5-round key-recovery sketch
//!
//! The historical attack adds one round at the end. For each candidate
//! value of the four bytes of `K_R5` that affect column 0 of the
//! post-round-4 state (positions 0, 7, 10, 13 — the same column-0
//! quartet as the differential attack), invert one round of the
//! ciphertext pair and check whether the resulting state has
//! single-active-byte difference at `(0,0)`. **Any such candidate is
//! provably wrong** (it would manifest a 4-round impossible
//! differential). With `2³²` guesses and a structure of `≈ 2¹⁶`
//! plaintexts, enough wrong guesses are eliminated to recover the four
//! key bytes uniquely.
//!
//! That full attack is `≈ 2⁹¹` operations as stated in the literature
//! and we do not run it here — see `DEFERRED.md`. The
//! [`key_byte_eliminations_5_round`] routine below runs the *one-byte*
//! version of the elimination over a small parameter range, sufficient
//! to demonstrate the elimination mechanism on a runnable scale.
