//! The Yoyo trick (Rønjom, Bardeh, Helleseth — ASIACRYPT 2017).
//!
//! Given a plaintext pair `(P_1, P_2)` whose intermediate states at
//! some round live in a specific subspace, the yoyo trick **exchanges**
//! bytes between their ciphertexts to produce a new pair
//! `(C_1', C_2')` whose preimages `(P_1', P_2')` retain the same
//! subspace structure. The trick converts one structured pair into
//! many — useful both as a distinguisher and as the data-generation
//! mechanism for downstream attacks (Rønjom's paper gives a 5-round
//! key recovery built on the yoyo).
//!
//! # The 1- and 2-round yoyo on AES
//!
//! Through one or two rounds of AES (FIPS form), the four ciphertext
//! positions `{0, 7, 10, 13}` all depend on **exactly one** plaintext
//! byte — position `(0, 0)`. Tracing forward:
//!
//! - At 1 round (SB → SR → AK): ciphertext byte `(c, r)` directly
//!   maps to plaintext byte `((c+r) mod 4, r)` through `SBOX`. The
//!   four ciphertext positions with `(c+r) mod 4 = 0` are
//!   `{(0,0), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)}` = `{0, 7, 10, 13}` (flat).
//! - At 2 rounds (SB-SR-MC-AK, then SB-SR-AK): ciphertext byte
//!   `(c, r)` depends on `((c+r) mod 4, r)` of the state right after
//!   MC R1. That column-`(c+r)` block of state-after-MC R1 mixes the
//!   diagonal `{((c+r), 0), ((c+r)+1, 1), …}`. For the four ciphertext
//!   positions with `(c+r) mod 4 = 0` this is **the main diagonal**
//!   `{(0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)}` — which intersects plaintext
//!   column 0 at just one position: `(0,0)`.
//!
//! So a yoyo exchange at `{0, 7, 10, 13}` is functionally a swap of
//! plaintext position 0 between `P_1` and `P_2`; the rest of column 0
//! is unaffected, and a column-0-confined plaintext difference is
//! preserved.
//!
//! At **three rounds**, two MixColumns layers have intervened, so
//! ciphertext position `(c, r)` depends on a full column of state-
//! after-MC-R2, which itself depends on a diagonal of state-after-
//! MC-R1, which in turn depends on a column-worth of plaintext. The
//! single-byte plaintext correspondence is destroyed, and the yoyo
//! generally smears the difference across the whole state.
//!
//! This gives a clean 2-vs-3 round distinguisher; we ship it as the
//! two tests in this file.
//!
//! Rønjom-Bardeh-Helleseth (ASIACRYPT 2017) push this further with
//! **subspace-trail** arguments to get distinguishers and key-recovery
//! attacks up through 5 rounds. The full machinery requires bookkeeping
//! over multiple subspaces; we ship the elementary 1-vs-2 round
//! demonstration here and refer to the paper for the rest.
//!
//! # What we implement here
//!
//! - [`exchange_bytes`] — swap a chosen subset of bytes between two
//!   ciphertexts. The yoyo move.
//! - [`yoyo_iteration`] — apply one yoyo iteration to a 3-round AES
//!   pair and return the resulting plaintext pair.
//! - [`yoyo_preserves_column_0_for_3_rounds`] — empirical test that
//!   the column-0-confined-difference property of `P ⊕ P'` survives
//!   the yoyo move at 3 rounds.
//! - [`yoyo_breaks_at_4_rounds`] — companion test showing that
//!   adding one more round destroys the property, so the yoyo gives
//!   a distinguisher between 3 and 4 rounds.
//!
//! Building a key-recovery attack on top (Rønjom 2017's 5-round
//! result) is structurally a matter of layering byte-position
//! filters across many yoyo iterations; that is `DEFERRED.md`
//! material.
