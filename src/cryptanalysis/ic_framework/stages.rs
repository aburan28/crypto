//! # The stages of an index-calculus pipeline, as plug points.
//!
//! An elliptic-curve index-calculus attack is the same five stages
//! whatever the variant, and each stage has one job with a stable
//! interface.  This module states those interfaces as traits so that a
//! variant is a *choice at each stage* rather than a fork of the whole
//! pipeline.
//!
//! ```text
//!   instance ──► factor base ──► targets ──► decomposition ──► relations ──► logarithm
//!                    │              │             │                │
//!            FactorBaseBuilder  TargetSource  DecompositionOracle  RelationSolver
//!                                                   │
//!                                             SystemSolver
//!                                        (algebraic oracles only)
//! ```
//!
//! ## What each stage owes the pipeline
//!
//! Every stage is handed a `&mut GroupOps` and must charge **every**
//! group operation it performs to it.  That is not a formality: the
//! whole point of the framework is that the end-to-end cost is the sum
//! of the stages, so a stage that does uncounted work makes the total a
//! fiction.  Engine-native work that is not a group operation — square
//! roots, table lookups, SAT conflicts, monomial operations — is
//! charged to the stage's own counters and converted once, at the end,
//! by the calibration.  See `docs/ic/FRAMEWORK.md` for the accounting
//! contract in full.
//!
//! ## Why the traits are generic over the group
//!
//! A prime-field curve, a random binary curve and a Koblitz curve differ
//! in their arithmetic and in what symmetries the factor base can fold,
//! but not in the shape of the pipeline.  [`CountedGroup`] is the
//! repository's existing abstraction for "a group whose every operation
//! is counted", so the stages are generic over it and a plug-in written
//! once runs on any regime whose group implements it.
