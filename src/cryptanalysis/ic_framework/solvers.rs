//! # Polynomial-system solvers, as plug-ins.
//!
//! The [`SystemSolver`] plug point takes a boolean system and returns
//! its solutions with a cost record.  It knows nothing about elliptic
//! curves, which is the point: a Gröbner implementer can work here
//! without reading a line of curve arithmetic, and the framework can
//! ask "what does this pipeline cost if the decomposition oracle solves
//! its systems with *that* engine instead" without touching anything
//! else.
//!
//! ## What ships here
//!
//! | name | engine | native unit |
//! |:--|:--|:--|
//! | `f4-f2` | Faugère's F4: batched pairs, symbolic preprocessing, bit-packed elimination, field pairs; a full reduced basis | word XORs (elimination only) |
//! | `buchberger-f2` | boolean-ring Buchberger with the coprime and chain criteria and the field-equation pairs, one pair at a time | monomial operations |
//! | `matrix-f4` | the Koblitz oracle's hybrid: Macaulay matrices to a fixed degree, then splitting | word XORs (elimination only) |
//! | `matrix-f5` | the same hybrid, rows the Boolean F5 criterion predicts to vanish left out | word XORs (elimination only) |
//! | `inherited-f4` | the same hybrid, children specialising their parent's reduced basis | word XORs (elimination and specialisation only) |
//! | `crossbred-f2` | Joux–Vitse: a Macaulay left kernel, then `2^k` linear solves | word operations (partial) |
//! | `xl-f2` | XL: multiply out to a degree, then linearise | monomial operations (modelled) |
//! | `sat-cdcl` | CDCL with Tseitin monomials and native parity rows | conflicts |
//! | `fes-f2` | fast exhaustive search, libfes-lite Gray code, quadratic systems only | word XORs (Gray-code steps) |
//! | `fes-f2-wide` | the same over 8 or 16 sub-cubes per step in the lanes of an AVX2 or AVX-512 register, ≤ 32 equations | vector XORs (Gray-code steps) |
//! | `exhaustive` | evaluate every equation at every point, stopping at the first that fails | monomial tests |
//!
//! The exhaustive searches are not strawmen.  They are the
//! **reference** the others are measured against, in the sense
//! `AGENTS.md` §1 means: the best algorithm that already solves the same
//! problem, priced in the same unit on the same instances.  `fes-f2-wide`
//! is the strongest wherever it applies, `fes-f2` next — two XORs per
//! point of `{0,1}^n`, or per sixteen points in the vector form, against
//! a pass over the terms — and a solver that cannot beat the strongest
//! one on a cell has not earned its place in that cell, however good its
//! asymptotics are said to be.
//!
//! ## Why every unit here is qualified
//!
//! The framework prices a count at the calibrated word-XOR ratio only
//! when the unit is exactly `word XORs`, meaning the count covers the
//! engine's whole run.  None of these does: F4's elimination is under a
//! third of its wall time at twelve unknowns (the products, symbolic
//! preprocessing and packing are the rest), and the hybrids count their
//! eliminations but not their matrix builds.  Pricing either at the XOR
//! ratio would flatter it by an order of magnitude, so each names what
//! its count covers and the runner prices it by wall time instead.  The
//! native count stays in the report as the engine's own regression
//! measure.
//!
//! ## Adding an engine — F4, F5, or anything else
//!
//! Implement [`SystemSolver`] and register it in [`solver_registry`].
//! The contract is short and all of it matters:
//!
//! - **Count something.**  `SolverCost::ops` with an `op_unit` naming
//!   it.  Wall time is never the metric (`AGENTS.md` §6); an engine
//!   that reports only time cannot be compared across hosts and will
//!   not be accepted into the table as a speed.
//! - **Respect the budget.**  Return [`SolverVerdict::BudgetExceeded`],
//!   never a wrong answer and never an unbounded run.
//! - **Never guess `Unsatisfiable`.**  Say it only when the system is
//!   decided.  An engine that reports a timeout as "no solution"
//!   quietly lowers the hit rate of every relation phase built on it.
//! - **Report a degree if you have one.**  `solving_degree` is the
//!   highest degree at which the run learned something; it is the one
//!   comparable against a degree bound.  `degree_reached` may be higher
//!   and is a property of the strategy.
//!
//! See `docs/ic/FRAMEWORK.md` for a worked example of adding one.
