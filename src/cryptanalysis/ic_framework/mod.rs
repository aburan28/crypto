//! # A pluggable index-calculus benchmarking framework.
//!
//! The repository's boundary ledger measures a fixed list of variants
//! end to end.  That is the right shape for *reporting* a result and
//! the wrong shape for *exploring* one: adding a variant means editing
//! the ladder, and comparing someone else's Gröbner engine against
//! ours means them forking it.
//!
//! This framework turns the same pipeline inside out.  Each stage is a
//! plug point, a run is a **choice at each stage**, and the report
//! carries every stage's cost in one unit so the effect of a choice is
//! visible where it lands rather than only in the total.
//!
//! ```text
//!   instance ──► factor base ──► targets ──► decomposition ──► relations ──► logarithm
//!                    │              │             │                │             │
//!            FactorBaseBuilder  Targets   DecompositionOracle  RelationSolver  verified
//!                                               │
//!                                         SystemSolver          ← F4, F5, XL, SAT, …
//! ```
//!
//! ## What a run answers
//!
//! The question the framework exists for is not "how fast is index
//! calculus" but **"what does changing *this* do to everything
//! downstream"**.  A report therefore carries, for one configuration:
//!
//! - the factor base's size, column count and build cost;
//! - the decomposition stage's trials, hit rate and cost per call, and,
//!   when the oracle is algebraic, the system's shape, the degree the
//!   solver reached and the degree a structureless system would have
//!   reached;
//! - the relation matrix's rows, rank and work;
//! - whether the recovered logarithm is right;
//! - and `S`, the whole thing divided by `√r`, so two configurations on
//!   different-sized instances are comparable.
//!
//! Change the factor base and the hit rate moves, which moves the
//! trials, which moves the matrix.  The report shows all four.
//!
//! ## The rules a run obeys
//!
//! These are `AGENTS.md`'s, and the framework enforces what it can:
//!
//! - **Every phase is inside the total.**  Base construction, table
//!   setup, failed decompositions, linear algebra and verification all
//!   land in `S`.  A number that prices one phase is a *stage
//!   diagnostic* and the report labels it as one.
//! - **Operation counts are the metric.**  Wall time rides along as a
//!   practicality note and is never the headline.
//! - **A row without a verified answer is not a result.**  The runner
//!   checks the recovered logarithm against the planted one and says so
//!   in the report; a configuration that does not recover it is
//!   reported, not hidden.
//! - **Budget exhaustion is not "no solution".**  A solver that runs
//!   out of budget is counted separately from one that refuted the
//!   system, because conflating them silently lowers the hit rate.
//!
//! ## Where to go next
//!
//! `docs/ic/FRAMEWORK.md` is the guide: the stage contracts in prose, a
//! worked example of adding a solver, how to run a sweep, and how to
//! report what comes out.
