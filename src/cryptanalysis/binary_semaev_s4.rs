//! # Symmetrised binary Semaev `S₄`, and its Weil descent.
//!
//! Companion to [`crate::cryptanalysis::binary_semaev`] (which handles
//! `S₃`).  Where `S₃` decomposes a point into **two** factor-base
//! points, `S₄` decomposes into **three** — and `m = 3` is where index
//! calculus starts to be worth doing at all: `m = 2` buys no asymptotic
//! improvement over Pollard ρ.
//!
//! ## Why symmetrise
//!
//! `S₄(X₁, X₂, X₃, x_R)` is symmetric in `X₁, X₂, X₃`, so it can be
//! rewritten over the elementary symmetric functions
//!
//! ```text
//!     e₁ = X₁ + X₂ + X₃
//!     e₂ = X₁X₂ + X₁X₃ + X₂X₃
//!     e₃ = X₁X₂X₃
//! ```
//!
//! which collapses the monomial count by roughly `m!` — the
//! Faugère–Gaudry–Huot–Renault speed-up.  Crucially it also drops the
//! *degree*: over the `eᵢ` the descended system is quadratic, where
//! over the `Xᵢ` it would be cubic.
//!
//! The price is that the `eᵢ` are not free: they must be tied back to
//! the `Xᵢ` by a **correspondence system**, which is where the cubic
//! degree goes.  So the model has two halves, and this module builds
//! both:
//!
//! | half | variables | degree | count |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | correspondence `eᵢ = σᵢ(X₁,X₂,X₃)` | `x` and `e` | ≤ 3 | `6l − 3` |
//! | descended `S₄` | `e` only | ≤ 2 | `n` |
//!
//! ## Frobenius is a relocation
//!
//! [`AnfF2m::square`] does no multiplication.  In characteristic 2,
//! `(Σ c_d z^d)² = Σ c_d² z^{2d}` — no cross terms — and each `c_d` is
//! an ANF over *Boolean* variables, where `a² = a` forces `c_d² = c_d`.
//! Both facts are needed; together they make squaring pure relocation
//! of coefficients from `d` to `2d`.  Of the twelve terms of `f₃`
//! below, including `e₁⁴`, `e₂⁴`, `e₃⁴` and `e₃³`, only four need a
//! genuine multiplication.
//!
//! ## Curve support
//!
//! The symmetrised form implemented here is specialised to `b = 1`,
//! i.e. the Koblitz curve `E: y² + xy = x³ + x² + 1`, which is the
//! curve the reference corpus in
//! `research/ec-index-calculus-review/` was generated on.  `S₄` does
//! not depend on `a₂`, but it *does* depend on `b`, and the `b`-powers
//! are folded into the constants below — a general-`b` form has to be
//! re-derived from `Res_X(S₃(X₁,X₂,X), S₃(X₃,x_R,X))` and then
//! re-symmetrised.  [`weil_descend_s4`] rejects `b ≠ 1` rather than
//! silently returning the wrong system.
