//! # Fast factor-base decomposition for binary Semaev `S₄`.
//!
//! The question an index-calculus run asks over and over: given a
//! target x-coordinate `x_R`, are there three factor-base elements
//! `X₁, X₂, X₃` with `S₄(X₁, X₂, X₃, x_R) = 0`?  Almost all of an
//! attack's time goes here, and almost all of *that* on the `~5/6` of
//! targets that do not decompose.
//!
//! # Don't enumerate triples
//!
//! The obvious method walks every sorted triple of the factor base —
//! `2^{3l}/3!` of them — and evaluates.  That is what
//! [`crate::cryptanalysis::semaev_corpus::CorpusInstance::decide_exhaustively`]
//! does, and what the SAT solver turns out to do as well (one conflict
//! per triple; see `research/notes/index-calculus/RESEARCH_SAT_SEMAEV.md`).
//!
//! But `S₄` is a *quartic in its last argument*.  Fix `X₁` and `X₂`
//! and it becomes a degree-4 polynomial in `X₃`, whose roots are the
//! only candidates worth considering.  So loop over **pairs**, not
//! triples, and solve for the third point:
//!
//! ```text
//!   for each pair (X₁ ≤ X₂):          2^{2l}/2 of them
//!       build the quartic in X₃
//!       find its roots that lie in the factor base
//! ```
//!
//! Finding those roots is the part that has to be cheap, and it is:
//! the factor base is an `F₂`-subspace `V`, so
//! `L_V(t) = Π_{v ∈ V}(t + v)` is a **linearized** polynomial,
//! `Σ aᵢ t^{2^i}`, with only `l + 1` coefficients despite having degree
//! `2^l`.  Reducing it modulo the quartic costs `l` squarings of a
//! degree-3 polynomial, and `gcd(quartic, L_V mod quartic)` then has
//! exactly the subspace roots as its roots.  No search over `V`.
//!
//! Per pair that is `O(l)` field operations instead of `2^l`
//! evaluations, so the saving grows like `2^l / l` — a constant factor
//! at `l = 5` and orders of magnitude by `l = 12`, which is where
//! enumeration stops being possible at all.
//!
//! # Where the time goes, and what was done about it
//!
//! Pairs-and-solve only pays off if a pair costs a few hundred field
//! operations rather than a few thousand.  Three things stood between
//! the first working version (28 µs per pair) and the current one
//! (about 1 µs):
//!
//! - **Inversions.**  A textbook polynomial remainder divides by the
//!   divisor's leading coefficient, and at `n = 24` one field inversion
//!   costs about fifty multiplications.  A single pair ran thirteen of
//!   them.  Now the modulus is made monic once — for a whole *row* of
//!   the pair loop at a time, by [`Gf2::batch_inv`] — and the gcd uses
//!   pseudo-remainders, which scale the dividend up instead of scaling
//!   the divisor down.  One inversion per row, none per pair.
//! - **The multiply itself.**  The schoolbook shift-and-xor loop runs
//!   `n` iterations with two unpredictable branches in each.  [`Gf2`]
//!   uses a carry-less multiply and folds the result down with two
//!   more, by the modulus's short tail (through a byte-indexed
//!   reduction table where that does not apply); squaring skips the
//!   multiply altogether, since in characteristic 2 it is bit-spreading.
//! - **Branches in straight-line code.**  Zero-operand early-outs and
//!   a "while the high part is non-zero" reduction loop both cost more
//!   in mispredictions than the work they skip.
//!
//! The general [`crate::binary_ecc::F2mElement`] is `Vec<u64>`-backed
//! and allocates twice per multiplication, which for a single-word
//! field costs about a hundred times what the arithmetic does; that is
//! why this module has its own field rather than reusing it.
//!
//! # This does not rescue index calculus
//!
//! Worth being explicit, because the speedups are large enough to be
//! misleading.  Collecting relations needs `2^l` of them; a random
//! target decomposes with probability `2^{3l−n}/3!`, so it takes
//! `3!·2^{n−3l}` targets per relation; and each target costs `Θ(2^{2l})`
//! here.  Multiply:
//!
//! ```text
//!   2^l · 3!·2^{n−3l} · Θ(2^{2l}) = Θ(2^n)
//! ```
//!
//! — **independent of `l`**.  A larger factor base needs fewer tries but
//! makes each try proportionally more expensive, and the two cancel
//! exactly.  Any oracle built on enumerating the factor base sits at
//! `2^n`, against `2^{n/2}` for Pollard rho, however fast its inner
//! loop.  `examples/semaev_decomp_bench.rs` measures this directly: the
//! projected relation-collection cost divided by `2^n` is flat across
//! the ladder.
//!
//! What the speed buys is not a better attack but a usable experiment.
//! Deciding a target at `l = 12` took hours by enumeration and takes
//! seconds here, which is the range where a genuinely sub-`2^{2l}`
//! oracle — the only thing that would change the conclusion — could be
//! tested.

// Nearly every pair produces a quartic of full degree, and for those
// [`roots_in_subspace`] can be done with a fraction of its field
// operations.  None of what follows changes the value computed: a
// remainder modulo a monic polynomial is unique, so this route and the
// generic one return the same coefficients, bit for bit.
//
// - **Squaring modulo `f` is semilinear.**  `φ(u) = u² mod f` satisfies
//   `φ(u + v) = φ(u) + φ(v)` and `φ(c·u) = c²·φ(u)`, so the sum
//   `Σ aᵢ t^{2^i}` has a Horner form in `φ`:
//
//       L_V(t) ≡ φ(φ(… φ(b_l t) + b_{l−1} t …) + b_1 t) + b_0 t,
//       b_j = a_j^{2^{−j}}.
//
//   The `b_j` depend only on the subspace and are computed once per
//   target.  Each Horner step is then a `φ` and one addition, where the
//   direct sum spent four multiplications per coefficient on top of the
//   same `φ`.  The top three steps never reach degree 4 before the
//   last, so they fold into one multiple of `t⁴ mod f`.
// - **`φ` by a table.**  `(Σ cᵢ tⁱ)² = Σ cᵢ² t^{2i}`, and of those
//   powers only `t⁴` and `t⁶` need reducing.  With `t⁴ mod f` (the low
//   coefficients of `f`, since `−1 = 1`) and `t⁶ mod f` computed once
//   per quartic, a squaring is four field squarings and eight
//   multiplications with no data-dependent branch.  `rem_monic` instead
//   scans down from `MAX_DEG` and eliminates three leading terms one
//   after another, each waiting on the last.

/// `L_V` rearranged for Horner evaluation under `φ`; see the section
