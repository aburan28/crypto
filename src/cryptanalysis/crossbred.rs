//! # Crossbred: Macaulay preprocessing, then bit-sliced exhaustive search.
//!
//! Joux and Vitse's answer to the question this repository keeps
//! running into — a Gröbner basis on a Weil-descended Semaev system is
//! an all-or-nothing computation whose degree of regularity decides
//! everything — is to stop halfway and finish by enumeration.
//!
//! Split the `n` Boolean unknowns into `k` that will be **enumerated**
//! and `n − k` that will be **solved for**.  Build the Macaulay matrix
//! of the system at degree `D` as usual, but instead of reducing it to
//! a basis, look for the `F_2`-combinations of its rows whose degree
//! *in the non-enumerated variables alone* drops to `d` (here `d = 1`).
//! Those combinations — the **crossbred polynomials** — are still in
//! the ideal, so every solution of the original system satisfies them;
//! but once the `k` enumerated variables are fixed, each one is a
//! **linear** form in the remaining `n − k`.  So the search phase is
//! `2^k` linear solves rather than `2^n` evaluations, and the algebra
//! only had to reach degree `D`, not the degree of regularity.
//!
//! ## Why this module exists here
//!
//! [`crate::cryptanalysis::koblitz_groebner`] solves the same systems
//! with matrix-F4 plus splitting, and
//! [`crate::cryptanalysis::semaev_decomp`] solves the `S₄` decomposition
//! by enumerating pairs.  Crossbred sits between them, and its search
//! phase is the part of this whole problem family that maps onto a GPU
//! without an argument: `2^k` independent points, no shared state, and
//! the per-point work is a bitwise AND against a precomputed table.
//!
//! `RESEARCH_RESIDUAL_WALKS.md` §11.7 names the Joux–Vitse family as
//! one of the two things that cut the index-calculus constant by orders
//! of magnitude.  This is the Boolean half of that family, measured in
//! the same units as everything else: `word_ops` on both phases, so a
//! crossbred row can be put next to an F4 row in one table.
//!
//! ## The preprocessing, concretely
//!
//! Let `E ⊆ {0,…,n−1}` be the enumerated variables (this module always
//! takes `E = {0,…,k−1}`, so an assignment of `E` is the low `k` bits of
//! a point).  For a Boolean monomial `t` write
//!
//! ```text
//!     specialised_degree(t) = popcount(t & !E)
//! ```
//!
//! — its degree in the variables that will *not* be enumerated.  Order
//! the Macaulay columns so the monomials with `specialised_degree > d`
//! come first; call those the **bad** columns.  A row combination that
//! is zero on every bad column is exactly a crossbred polynomial.  So
//! the preprocessing is one left-kernel computation: row-reduce
//! `[M_bad | I]` and keep the `I`-part of every row whose `M_bad` part
//! vanished.
//!
//! That left kernel is a vector space, and this module returns a basis
//! of it.  Its dimension is the honest measure of whether crossbred
//! applies to a given system at a given `(D, k, d)`: dimension zero
//! means the preprocessing bought nothing and the search phase would be
//! unconstrained.
//!
//! ## The search, concretely
//!
//! With `d = 1` each crossbred polynomial `P` splits as
//!
//! ```text
//!     P  =  c_0(x_E)  +  Σ_j  c_j(x_E) · y_j
//! ```
//!
//! where `y_j` runs over the non-enumerated variables and every `c` is a
//! Boolean function of the enumerated variables only, given in algebraic
//! normal form by construction.  Evaluating one `c` at all `2^k` points
//! at once is the **Möbius transform** of its ANF vector, `k · 2^{k−1}`
//! bit operations for the whole cube, and the result is naturally
//! bit-sliced at 64 points per word.  [`mobius_transform`] does that in
//! place.
//!
//! Two kinds of crossbred polynomial come out, and they are used
//! differently:
//!
//! - `specialised_degree = 0` — the polynomial involves *only*
//!   enumerated variables, so it is a **filter**: a point can only be
//!   part of a solution if the polynomial evaluates to zero there.
//!   Filters combine with a bitwise `AND` of complemented tables, 64
//!   points per instruction, and reject almost everything.  This is the
//!   kernel a GPU would run.
//! - `specialised_degree = 1` — the polynomial is a linear form once the
//!   point is fixed.  Surviving points assemble their rows into a small
//!   `F_2` system and solve it.
//!
//! Every candidate is verified against the **original** equations before
//! it is returned, so nothing spurious escapes even if the crossbred
//! extraction is wrong.
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! - Solving is implemented for `d = 1` only.  Extraction runs at any
//!   `d` — it is the same kernel computation — because the dimension of
//!   the crossbred space as a function of `d` is worth measuring even
//!   where this module cannot then search.
//! - When a fixed assignment leaves the linear system rank-deficient,
//!   the affine solution space is enumerated up to
//!   [`SearchOptions::max_kernel_dim`]; beyond that the run sets
//!   `exhausted` rather than silently dropping solutions.
//! - The preprocessing is a dense left kernel.  That is `O(R²·(B+R)/64)`
//!   word operations on an `R`-row Macaulay matrix, and it is why
//!   `max_rows` exists.
