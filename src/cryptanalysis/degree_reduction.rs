//! # Buying down the Gröbner solving degree `D*` — lever L3 (hybrid slicing).
//!
//! The FFD program (`RESEARCH_FFD_PROOF_COMPLEXITY.md`,
//! `RESEARCH_FFD_WORKFLOW.md`) measures `D*`, the degree at which the
//! Macaulay/Gröbner computation on a Weil-descended Semaev system
//! terminates, and establishes two facts we now use *offensively*:
//!
//! - **P6** — over-determination collapses `D*`: at determination ratio
//!   `ρ = #eqs/#vars ≫ 1` the system admits a degree-2 Nullstellensatz
//!   certificate, so `D* = 2`.
//! - **P3-alg** — `D*` decreases with the early Hilbert-function defect
//!   `Δ_low` (slope ≈ −7.6 degrees per unit defect in the critical regime).
//!
//! P6 was recorded as a *nuisance* — the reason the early single-sample
//! harness saw a spuriously flat `D*`. But `ρ` is not fixed by the problem:
//! an attacker can **raise it at will** by guessing `k` of the `N = 2n'`
//! Boolean variables and solving the `2^k` resulting slices. That is the
//! Bettale–Faugère–Perret *hybrid approach*, and this module makes it
//! measurable on descended Semaev systems.
//!
//! ## Why the accounting is exact here
//!
//! Fix a target `x₃` that is **non-decomposable** over the factor base `V`
//! (the common case in index calculus — most relation attempts fail). The
//! descended system `Σ` is then unsatisfiable, and so is *every* one of the
//! `2^k` slices obtained by fixing `k` variables. Hence:
//!
//! - every slice refutes, so `D*` is defined on all of them (no censoring
//!   from "this slice happened to be satisfiable");
//! - the slices **partition** the search space, so the hybrid is not an
//!   approximation — it covers exactly what the direct solve covered;
//! - total work is `Σ_slices cost(D*_slice)`, which sampling estimates as
//!   `2^k · E[cost(D*_slice)]`.
//!
//! So the trade is clean: `2^k` multiplicative slices bought against a
//! (hopefully) collapsing `D*` in each. This module measures both halves
//! and reports the crossover.
//!
//! ## What we expose
//!
//! - [`specialize`] — substitute constants for a chosen set of Boolean
//!   variables and re-index the survivors (an exact affine slice of `Σ`).
//! - [`GuessPattern`] — *which* variables to fix. `OneSide` (all from the
//!   `X₁` half) is index calculus's asymmetric factor-base split;
//!   `Balanced` splits evenly; `Spread` picks uniformly at random.
//! - [`HybridRow`] / [`run_hybrid_sweep`] — the `D*`-vs-`k` curve with a
//!   histogram-exact cost model, so the linear-algebra exponent `ω` can be
//!   varied after the fact ([`HybridRow::log2_total_cost`]).
//!
//! ## Reading the output — and the baseline that actually matters
//!
//! `log2_total_cost(ω) = k + log₂ E[cols(N−k, D*)^ω]` is the log₂ work of
//! the whole hybrid at that `k`; `k = 0` is the direct solve.
//!
//! Beating `k = 0` is **not** the bar. The `k = N` endpoint of this same
//! family is brute-force enumeration of `V × V`, so at toy sizes the cost
//! model will happily report that "guessing more always helps" — it is
//! drifting toward exhaustive search, which is genuinely fastest when
//! `2^N` is small. Any gate keyed only on the `k = 0` comparison measures
//! that artifact and nothing else.
//!
//! So the honest comparison is against [`log2_enumeration_cost`] (`2^N`
//! Semaev evaluations, charged generously at `O(1)` amortised each), and
//! the scaling quantity is [`HybridSweep::collapse_fraction`] — the
//! fraction `c = k/N` at which `D*` reaches the Nullstellensatz floor of 2.
//! Total hybrid work is `2^{cN}·poly`, so the lever is a real speedup only
//! if `c < 1`, and survives to cryptographic size only if `c` does not
//! drift upward with `N`.

// ── Lever L4: degree falls (mutants) ────────────────────────────────
//
// A *syzygy* and a *degree fall* are not the same thing, and the
// distinction decides whether this lever exists at all.
//
// EXP-J (`examples/ffd_syzygy.rs`) found that the descended Semaev system
// carries exactly one excess relation at degree 3, of the form
// `Σ_i ℓ_i · f_i ≡ 0`. That is a **pure syzygy**: the combination vanishes
// identically, so it yields no polynomial. Adding it to the generating set
// adds literally nothing; it only costs the solver one zero reduction,
// which is a constant factor (what F5's criterion avoids), not a degree.
//
// A **degree fall** is the other case: a combination of degree-`D` rows
// whose degree-`D` part cancels but whose remainder is **nonzero**, hence a
// new element of the ideal of degree `≤ D−1`. That *is* worth adding, and
// the reason is not that the solver cannot find it — at degree `D` it
// already has it in its row space — but that once `g` is a generator, the
// rows `x_k · g` become available at degree `D`, and those are degree-`D+1`
// products of the original generators. The Macaulay tower genuinely
// accelerates. This is the mutant mechanism of MutantXL / the degree-fall
// strategy used against HFE.
//
// So `extract_degree_falls` separates the two populations and returns only
// the falls, and only those independent of the generators already present.
