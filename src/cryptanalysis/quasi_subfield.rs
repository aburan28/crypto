//! # The search, in characteristic 2
//!
//! Take `q = 2`.  A monic `2`-linearised polynomial
//! `L(X) = X^{2^{n0}} + Σ_{i<n0} c_i X^{2^i}` acts `F_2`-linearly on
//! `F_{2^n}`, and it splits completely there with a root set that is an
//! `F_2`-subspace **iff that linear map has kernel of dimension exactly
//! `n0`**.  So "splits completely" is a rank condition on an `n × n`
//! matrix over `F_2`, which is cheap, and the whole question becomes a
//! finite search over the coefficient vector `(c_0, …, c_{n0−1})`.
//!
//! `λ(X) = Σ_{i<n0} c_i X^{2^i}` has `deg λ = 2^j` with
//! `j = max{ i : c_i ≠ 0 }`, so the quasi-subfield condition is
//! `j < n0²/n`: **every coefficient from index `⌈n0²/n⌉` upward must
//! vanish.**  That is what [`search`] enumerates, over the coefficients
//! that are allowed to be non-zero.
//!
//! # Why the answer is not obvious
//!
//! Counting heuristically: the search space has `2^{t·n}` points with
//! `t = ⌈n0²/n⌉`, and a random `F_2`-linear map has an `n0`-dimensional
//! kernel with probability of order `2^{−n0²}`.  Since `t·n ≈ n0²`, the
//! expected number of solutions is of order **one** — the question sits
//! exactly on the first-moment threshold, which is why a statistical
//! argument does not settle it and an exhaustive census does.
//!
//! [`lemma_4_1_bound`] reports the paper's lower bound in both forms,
//! with and without the `n mod n0` term, so a census that finds a
//! quasi-subfield polynomial below the stripped bound is direct evidence
//! that the term cannot be removed.
