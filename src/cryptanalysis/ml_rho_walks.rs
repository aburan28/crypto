//! **Adversarial-ML Pollard rho on toy elliptic curves**.
//!
//! Per the agent's TOP-3 list, train a small transformer to predict
//! optimal walk-step choices in Pollard rho on a toy Solinas-form
//! curve.  Compare against the standard r-adding walk to see whether
//! ML can learn shorter paths to collisions.
//!
//! # Why this might be interesting
//!
//! Pollard rho's expected `O(√n)` runtime depends on the walk
//! function being "random-like."  The standard r-adding walks
//! (Teske, Cheon-Hong) have proven good distribution properties, but
//! they're not provably *optimal*.  An adversarial-ML walk could in
//! principle:
//!
//! 1. **Memorise structural features** of the curve that make some
//!    paths converge faster.
//! 2. **Learn distinguishing-point heuristics** beyond the standard
//!    "leading-zero" criterion.
//! 3. **Exploit Solinas-prime structure** (the carries in P-256-style
//!    reduction might leak information about distance-to-collision).
//!
//! Negative result is publishable (rules out "ML breaks ECDLP"
//! sentiment).  Positive result is foundational.
//!
//! # Implementation status
//!
//! **This module ships the framework**, not the trained model.
//!
//! Training a transformer requires a GPU and PyTorch/JAX, which is
//! out of scope for a Rust cryptanalysis library.  We provide:
//!
//! 1. **Trace-emission API**: emit `(state, action, reward)` tuples
//!    from a Pollard rho run on a toy curve.  Output format is JSON
//!    Lines, ready for ingestion by an external ML training pipeline.
//! 2. **Walk function abstraction**: `WalkFn` trait so a future
//!    `MLWalk` can plug into the existing `pollard_rho` infrastructure.
//! 3. **Standard r-adding walk** baseline implementation.
//! 4. **Performance harness**: average steps to collision over many
//!    seeds, comparing baseline vs (future) ML walk.
//!
//! # Experimental design (for the GPU-equipped researcher)
//!
//! 1. Pick a toy curve (e.g., Solinas-form prime `p ≈ 2³² − 2¹⁶ + 1`,
//!    cyclic group order ≈ 2³²).  Solving DLP via brute-force is
//!    feasible but slow; provides ground truth for training.
//! 2. **Generate training data**: run baseline Pollard rho 10⁴ times
//!    with random seeds.  At each step, log `(state_features,
//!    action_taken, did_eventually_hit_DP)`.  This is `~10⁹` tuples,
//!    ~10 GB of training data.
//! 3. **Architecture**: small transformer (4 layers, 256-dim embedding,
//!    8 attention heads).  Input: state features (point coordinates
//!    in compressed form, recent walk history, current bit-mask).
//!    Output: action probability over the `r` walk-function indices.
//! 4. **Loss**: REINFORCE-style, reward = -log(steps to next DP).
//!    Train ~10⁵ epochs.
//! 5. **Evaluate**: average steps-to-collision over 10³ test seeds,
//!    compare to baseline.
//!
//! Cost estimate (per agent's note): ~$1k of GPU time.
