//! # EXP-R6 / lever **L5** — the curve-side lever: can an isogeny make the
//! Gröbner basis easier?
//!
//! `RESEARCH_DEGREE_REDUCTION.md` measures four levers (L1–L4), all of
//! which change the *presentation* of one fixed curve's decomposition
//! ideal.  This module measures the one lever that changes the **curve**:
//! the ECDLP transports along an isogeny `φ: E → E'` of degree coprime to
//! the subgroup order, so an attacker is free to solve the problem on any
//! curve in the isogeny class of `E` and pull the answer back.  If some
//! `E'` in the class had a materially lower solving degree `D*`, that would
//! be an attack on `E`.  This is the Galbraith–Hess–Smart move ("walk to a
//! weaker isogenous curve", which worked for Weil descent) asked of
//! Gröbner-basis solving degree instead of GHS genus.
//!
//! The module answers the question for ECC2K-130 specifically, and the
//! answer is negative for three independent reasons, each *derived* rather
//! than measured.  They are the thread's boundaries, so they are stated
//! before any search runs.
//!
//! ## Boundary A — the class is bigger than ρ
//!
//! For the Koblitz curve `E: y² + xy = x³ + 1` over `F_{2^131}`,
//! `End(E) ⊗ Q = Q(√−7)` with `d_K = −7`, `h(−7) = 1`.  Writing
//! `τ² + τ + 2 = 0` for the Frobenius of `F_2` and `π = τ^131`, the
//! conductor of `Z[π]` in `O_K = Z[τ]` is
//!
//! ```text
//!   c = 38531015900842053623 = 263 · 146505763881528721   (both prime)
//! ```
//!
//! and the class — every curve `F_{2^131}`-isogenous to `E` — has exactly
//!
//! ```text
//!   Σ_{f | c} h(O_f) = 38531015900842054149 ≈ 2^65.06     vertices,
//!   h(O_f) = f · Π_{ℓ | f} (1 − (d_K/ℓ)/ℓ)                (h_K = 1, unit index 1).
//! ```
//!
//! Pollard ρ on a group of order `r` whose automorphism group has order `m`
//! and acts freely walks on `r/m` classes, so the birthday bound is
//! `√(π(r/m)/2) = √(πr/2m)`.  For ECC2K-130 the automorphism group is
//! negation together with the 131 Frobenius powers, `m = 2 · 131 = 262`:
//!
//! ```text
//!   plain ρ, m = 1      √(πr/2)    = 2^64.83
//!   negation, m = 2     √(πr/4)    = 2^64.33
//!   full, m = 262       √(πr/524)  = 2^60.81   ← the ECC2K-130 effort's target
//! ```
//!
//! **Enumerating the isogeny class costs more than solving the DLP by ρ**, at
//! one operation per vertex, before any per-vertex Gröbner work is charged —
//! `2^4.25×` against the automorphism-assisted ρ.  The margin is much thinner
//! against plain ρ, only `2^0.24×`, so Boundary A is reported against both:
//! the *sign* is what it rests on, and that holds either way.
//!
//! (An earlier revision of this module divided `√(πr/4)` by `√(2·131)`.  That
//! applies negation twice — `√(πr/4)` is already `m = 2` — and understated ρ
//! by half a bit.  Caught in review on PR #203.)
//!
//! ## Boundary B — 263 of those `2^65` vertices are reachable, and that is all
//!
//! Because `h(−7) = 1` the crater of every `ℓ`-volcano is a **single
//! vertex, `E` itself**: horizontal `ℓ`-isogenies act through
//! `Cl(O_K) = 1`, so they return to `E` (`j ↦ j`), and descending
//! `ℓ`-isogenies exist only for `ℓ | c`.  Hence
//!
//! - for **every** prime `ℓ ∉ {263, 146505763881528721}` the `ℓ`-isogeny
//!   graph of `E` is a single vertex — there is no small-`ℓ` walk to take;
//! - `ℓ = 263` splits (`(−7/263) = +1`), giving `263 − 1 = 262` descending
//!   isogenies onto a depth-1 floor, all adjacent to `E`;
//! - `ℓ = p = 146505763881528721` is inert, giving `p + 1` descending
//!   isogenies — each with a kernel polynomial of degree `(p−1)/2 ≈ 2^56`,
//!   whose kernel points live in an extension of `F_{2^131}` of degree
//!   dividing `p − 1`.  Unreachable.
//!
//! So the **exhaustive, terminating** search over the computationally
//! reachable part of the class is over `1 + 262 = 263` curves — `2^8` of
//! `2^65.06`, a fraction of `6.8 × 10^{-18}`.  [`ReachAccounting`] does
//! this bookkeeping for any degree budget.
//!
//! ## Boundary C — the curve enters *below* the leading form
//!
//! Boundaries A and B bound the search.  This one says what a search could
//! possibly find.  For a binary curve `y² + xy = x³ + a₂x² + a₆`, Semaev's
//! `S₃` is
//!
//! ```text
//!   S₃(x₁,x₂,x₃) = (x₁x₂)² + (x₁x₃)² + (x₂x₃)² + x₁x₂x₃ + a₆
//! ```
//!
//! — independent of `a₂`, and `a₆` appears as an **additive constant**.
//! `a₆ = 1/j` is therefore the *entire* curve-dependence of the `m = 2`
//! decomposition system, and after Weil descent into `n` Boolean equations
//! it moves **only the constant term of each equation**: the degree-`≥ 1`
//! part is byte-identical for every curve over the field.
//!
//! At `m = 3` the same holds with room to spare.  Expanding
//! `S₄ = Res_X(S₃(X₁,X₂,X), S₃(X₃,x_R,X))` in `a₆` gives exactly
//!
//! ```text
//!   S₄ = [A₁(X₃x_R)² + A₂(X₁X₂)²]²                 a₆-free, Boolean degree 3
//!      + (A₁B₂ + A₂B₁)(B₁(X₃x_R)² + B₂(X₁X₂)²)     a₆-free, Boolean degree 6
//!      + a₆  · (A₁B₂ + A₂B₁)(B₁ + B₂)              Boolean degree ≤ 5
//!      + a₆² · (A₁ + A₂)²                          Boolean degree 1
//! ```
//!
//! with `A₁ = (X₁+X₂)², B₁ = X₁X₂, A₂ = (X₃+x_R)², B₂ = X₃x_R`, and Boolean
//! degrees counted with squaring free (`F_2`-linear), so `A₁, A₂, B₂` are
//! degree 1 and `B₁` is degree 2.  The top Boolean degree is 6 and it is
//! `a₆`-free; every `a₆`-carrying term sits in degree `≤ 5`.  The identity is verified, not asserted — see
//! `s4_a6_expansion_is_quadratic_with_subleading_coefficients`.
//!
//! **What this does and does not cover.**  The leading-form ideal is
//! curve-independent, so the degree of regularity in the
//! Bardet–Faugère–Salvy sense — a Hilbert-series invariant of the
//! leading forms — is constant on the whole isogeny class, and so is the
//! degree at which any top-degree cancellation first becomes *available*.
//! It does **not** cover the affine refutation degree `D*` that this
//! repository actually measures (`pc_degree_harness::refutation_scan`: the
//! degree at which `1` enters the Macaulay row space).  `D*` is a property
//! of the *inhomogeneous* system, and the curve controls precisely the
//! inhomogeneous part, so `D*` does vary with `a₆`.  Measured at `n = 8`,
//! `l = 4` over all 255 curves it takes values `{2, 3, 4}`.  That variation
//! is the lever's entire remaining surface, so it is what EXP-R6 measures.
//!
//! ## The mechanism, derived
//!
//! The variation is not mysterious and it is not a curve *quality*.  Write
//! the descended system as `f_i = h_i + c_i` with `h_i` the degree-`≥ 1`
//! part (curve-independent) and `c_i ∈ F_2` the constant.  Let
//!
//! ```text
//!   S = { λ ∈ F_2^n : Σ λ_i h_i = 0 }
//! ```
//!
//! be the left null space of the leading parts — again curve-independent.
//! For `λ ∈ S`, `Σ λ_i f_i = ⟨λ, c⟩` is a *constant*, so the Macaulay matrix
//! refutes already at degree 2 exactly when `⟨λ, c⟩ = 1` for some `λ ∈ S`:
//!
//! ```text
//!   D* = 2   ⟺   c ∉ S^⊥,   so the fraction of curves refuting at
//!                degree 2 is 1 − 2^{−dim S}.
//! ```
//!
//! Since `a₆ ↦ c` is an affine bijection `F_{2^n} → F_2^n`, sweeping the
//! curve *is* sweeping the constant vector over the whole space.  So the
//! set of "good" curves is the complement of an affine subspace — and that
//! subspace **depends on the target `x_R`**.  A curve that is good for one
//! target is good for a `1 − 2^{−dim S}` fraction of targets and no more:
//! there is no curve that is good for all of them, and an attack has to
//! solve one decomposition instance per relation, each with its own target.
//! [`syzygy_mechanism`] measures `dim S` and checks the predicted density
//! against the exhaustive count; [`curve_effect_test`] checks the
//! consequence — that a curve selected as best on one target set keeps no
//! margin on a disjoint one.
//!
//! ## Boundary D — factor-base structure belongs to the field, not the curve
//!
//! The only lever the FFD program has measured to lower `D*` materially is
//! L1, a **subfield** factor base (mean `D*` 2.04 against 3.53 for a random
//! base).  An isogeny is defined over the field it starts in, so `F_{2^131}`
//! and every `F_2`-subspace of it are identical before and after: whatever
//! factor-base structure exists over that field is available on **every curve
//! in the class equally**, and so distinguishes none of them.  An isogeny
//! cannot make a factor-base mechanism available that `E` did not already
//! have.
//!
//! An earlier revision argued instead that `131` is prime, so `F_{2^131}` has
//! no proper subfield and L1 is therefore unreachable.  True of proper
//! subfields but too strong as a claim about the mechanism: subfield-*like*
//! bases do not need one — quasi-subfield polynomials
//! (Huang–Kosters–Petit–Yeo–Yun) supply them at prime `n`, and
//! `RESEARCH_QUASI_SUBFIELD.md` exhibits genuine non-subfield examples over
//! `F_{2^7}`.  The field-invariance form above does not depend on that question
//! either way.  For `n = 131` the census in that note happens to find no
//! quasi-subfield cell either, so the mechanism is doubly out of reach here.
//!
//! ## What is therefore measured
//!
//! Boundary C is a statement about *all* curves, so it is tested the
//! strongest way available: [`exhaustive_a6_sweep`] measures `D*` for
//! **every** curve over `F_{2^n}` — all `2^n − 1` values of `a₆`, a superset
//! of every isogeny class at that size, the Koblitz one included.  The
//! containment is what makes an exhaustive statement possible at a size
//! where the `2^65` class is not enumerable: whatever the isogeny-reachable
//! curves do, the sweep has already done it.
//!
//! Three numbers come out, and the third is the one that decides:
//!
//! 1. `dim S` and the predicted-versus-measured density of `D* = 2`
//!    ([`syzygy_mechanism`]) — does the derived mechanism hold exactly?
//! 2. the between-curve variance of mean `D*` against what independent
//!    sampling from the pooled distribution predicts — is the curve the
//!    explanatory variable at all?
//! 3. the **holdout margin** ([`curve_effect_test`]): take the curve that
//!    looks best on one target set, re-measure it on a disjoint one.  A
//!    lever that is real keeps its margin; a winner's curse does not.
