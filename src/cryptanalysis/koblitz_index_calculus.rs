//! # Index calculus for Koblitz (subfield) curves with Frobenius-invariant factor bases.
//!
//! Implementation of the algorithm of **Galbraith, Granger, Merz and
//! Petit**, *On index calculus algorithms for subfield curves*
//! (SAC 2020, ePrint 2020/1315).  A Koblitz curve
//!
//! ```text
//!     K_a :  y² + x y = x³ + a x² + 1,      a ∈ {0, 1}
//! ```
//!
//! is defined over `F_2` but used over `F_{2^n}`.  Because the curve
//! equation has `F_2`-coefficients, the `2`-power Frobenius
//!
//! ```text
//!     π(x, y) = (x², y²)
//! ```
//!
//! is an endomorphism of `E(F_{2^n})`, and on the large prime-order
//! subgroup `⟨P⟩` it acts as multiplication by a known scalar `λ`
//! (a root of `λ² − t λ + 2 ≡ 0 mod r`, `t = (−1)^{1−a}` the trace of
//! Frobenius over `F_2`).  Pollard rho exploits that with a `√n`
//! speed-up; the GGMP paper shows index calculus gets a **larger**
//! speed-up: `≈ n` in relation collection and `≈ n²` in the linear
//! algebra.
//!
//! ## Where the speed-up comes from
//!
//! Take a factor base `F ⊆ E(F_{2^n})` that is *Frobenius invariant*,
//! `π(F) = F`.  Then `F` splits into `π`-orbits, each of size dividing
//! `n`, and if `P' = π^k(Q)` with `Q` an orbit representative then
//!
//! ```text
//!     log_P P' = λ^k · log_P Q      (mod r).
//! ```
//!
//! Negation adds `log_P(-Q) = -log_P(Q)`, so the `|F|` unknowns of a
//! classical index calculus collapse to one per signed Frobenius orbit,
//! generically `≈ |F| / (2n)`. Consequences:
//!
//! - **Relation collection:** we need one relation per signed orbit
//!   unknown instead of one per factor-base point.
//! - **Linear algebra:** Frobenius shrinks the relation matrix by a factor `n` in
//!   *both* dimensions, so a quadratic (sparse-linear-algebra) solve
//!   costs `n²` less; negation removes the redundant opposite columns.
//! - **Symmetry breaking:** a decomposition `R = P_1 + … + P_m` is
//!   found `m!` times if the summands are searched independently.
//!   Distributing the summands over the shifted factor bases
//!   `F_i = π^{i−1}(F)` — which for an invariant base all equal `F` —
//!   and requiring the tuple to be ordered removes that `m!`.  Each
//!   summand `P_i = π^{k_i}(Q_{j_i})` contributes `λ^{k_i}` to column
//!   `j_i` of the relation, which is exactly the "rewrite the relation
//!   so that all `P'_i ∈ F_1 = F`" step of the paper.
//!
//! ## Frobenius-invariant factor bases from linearised polynomials
//!
//! The paper's construction (their §4, and the "Examples of Frobenius
//! invariant factor bases" slide of the SAC talk):
//!
//! 1. Factor `x^n − 1 = (x − 1) f_1 f_2 ⋯ f_s` in `F_2[x]`.
//!    For odd `n` the factors are distinct. When `n` is an odd prime,
//!    the nontrivial factors all have degree `ℓ := ord_n(2)` (GGMP,
//!    Lemma 4.1); for composite odd `n`, their degrees can differ.
//! 2. For `f_j = Σ_k f_{j,k} x^k` form the **linearised** polynomial
//!    `F_j(X) = Σ_k f_{j,k} X^{2^k}`.  Its root set in `F_{2^n}` is an
//!    `F_2`-subspace `V_j` of dimension `deg f_j` (the `F_2[x] ≅ {linearised
//!    polynomials under composition}` isomorphism sends `x^n − 1` to
//!    `X^{2^n} − X`, so `F_j` divides `X^{2^n} − X`), and `V_j` is
//!    closed under squaring because the `f_{j,k}` lie in `F_2`.
//! 3. `F := { P ∈ E(F_{2^n}) \ {O} : F_j(x(P)) = 0 }` is Frobenius
//!    invariant. Its rational-point count depends on which coordinates
//!    lift to the curve; only the coordinate count `|V_j| = 2^(deg f_j)`
//!    is exact from the kernel dimension.
//!
//! `V_j` is computed here as the kernel of the `F_2`-linear map
//! `v ↦ F_j(v)` on `F_{2^n}`, which is both simpler and self-checking
//! (the kernel dimension must come out equal to `deg f_j`).
//!
//! The implementation also supports smaller invariant nonlinear sets:
//! a seed subspace can be closed under Frobenius, then optionally under
//! translation by rational 2-torsion.  These domains are represented by
//! their exact finite coordinate set.  SAT constrains every summand with
//! a prefix trie for that set; it does not replace the nonlinear domain
//! with its full linear span.
//!
//! ## Honest scope
//!
//! - **Three decomposition oracles.**  "Is `R` a sum of `m` factor-base
//!   points?" can be answered by
//!   [`DecompositionStrategy::Groebner`] — Semaev's `S₃` Weil-restricted
//!   to a low-degree Boolean system over the invariant subspace and
//!   solved with matrix-F4 (see
//!   [`crate::cryptanalysis::koblitz_groebner`]) — by
//!   [`DecompositionStrategy::Sat`], which encodes the descended
//!   equations with native XOR rows and exact factor-base membership,
//!   or by
//!   [`DecompositionStrategy::Enumerate`], a table-driven search over
//!   ordered tuples costing `|F|^{m−1}` group operations.  They are
//!   cross-checked against each other on the toy cases in the tests.
//!   At the sizes this module can reach the search is still 10–100×
//!   *faster* in wall-clock terms: `|F|` is a few dozen points, so
//!   `|F|^{m−1}` is nothing, while the Macaulay matrix already has
//!   thousands of columns.  A completed Gröbner or SAT refutation proves
//!   that the encoded decomposition does not exist; an exhausted budget
//!   remains inconclusive.  The exact factor-base coverage results do not
//!   establish a SAT speedup or a solving-complexity bound.
//! - **Toy / research rungs only.**  Curve construction via
//!   [`KoblitzCurve::new`] is guarded by [`MAX_N`] (currently 63) so the
//!   factor base can be materialised and the group order factored.  This
//!   does not threaten sect163k1 or any other deployed Koblitz curve —
//!   as the paper's own conclusion puts it, index calculus remains
//!   *worse* than rho for curves used in practice.

// ── Factor-base logarithms and individual-logarithm descent ─────────

// A CADO-NFS-style pipeline separates two costs that the plain driver
// above conflates.  The plain driver bakes the target `Q` into every
// relation (`R = [a]G + [b]Q`) and rebuilds the whole relation matrix
// per target.  A production pipeline instead:
//
//   1. **precomputes**, once per curve and factor base, the discrete
//      logarithm of every relation column — the *factor-base logarithm
//      database*;
//   2. **descends** each target with a single relation, reading the
//      column logs out of that database — the *individual logarithm*.
//
// Both stages live here because they need the private projected-orbit
// map and relation builder.  Only the projected representation is
// supported (the `ic` default): its columns are the canonical
// cofactor projections `R_o ∈ ⟨G⟩`, so a column logarithm
// `x_o = log_G R_o` is a genuine discrete log that certifies itself —
// `[x_o]G == R_o` — with no reliance on the collection being correct.
