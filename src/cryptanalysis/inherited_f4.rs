//! # Inherited matrix-F4: the reduced Macaulay basis specialised down the splitting tree.
//!
//! The Koblitz decomposition oracle
//! ([`super::koblitz_groebner::solve_boolean_system`]) is a DPLL loop
//! around a Macaulay reduction: at every node it takes the current system,
//! builds the degree-`D` Macaulay matrix from scratch, reduces it, reads
//! off the refutation or the forced variables, and recurses on
//! `v := 0` and `v := 1`.  Every child rebuilds and re-reduces a matrix
//! that is a *specialisation* of the one its parent has just reduced.
//!
//! F5's organising idea is to never redo a reduction the algorithm can
//! predict.  Here the prediction is exact.  Substitution `φ_c : v ↦ c` is a
//! ring homomorphism of the Boolean ring, and the Macaulay rows of the
//! specialised system are the images of the parent's rows:
//!
//! ```text
//!     V(S|_{v=c})  =  φ_c( V(S) )  =  span{ φ_c(ρ) : ρ a reduced row of the parent }
//! ```
//!
//! (up to multipliers that cannot reach the linear tail, and up to a
//! generator whose degree *drops* under `φ_c` gaining multipliers — see
//! [`ReducedBasis::specialise`] for both).  So the child's row space is
//! spanned by the `rank` reduced rows of its parent, specialised — and most
//! of them are already in echelon form:
//!
//! - under `v := 0` every monomial containing `v` is deleted; a row whose
//!   leading monomial does not contain `v` keeps it;
//! - under `v := 1` every monomial `m ∋ v` folds into `m ∖ v`, which is
//!   *smaller* in any degree-compatible order, so again a leading monomial
//!   without `v` survives and cannot be cancelled.
//!
//! Only the rows whose **pivot contains `v`** lose their place and are
//! re-reduced against the rest — about `D/n` of them.  No Macaulay matrix
//! is built below the root, and no reduction is repeated.  Because the
//! row space is the same one the from-scratch step would compute, the
//! linear tail — hence every refutation, forced variable, split and
//! verdict — is identical; only the work per node changes.
//!
//! ## Accounting
//!
//! The stage's unit is 64-bit word XORs in the elimination.  Everything
//! this module does to a packed row is charged in that unit: the root
//! reduction through the shared kernel, every XOR of the re-reduction, and
//! the specialisation itself at one word operation per word read and per
//! word written — a charge the from-scratch path never pays, since its
//! matrix build is not counted.  Rows are stored from their first nonzero
//! word, so a rewrite reads the words from the row's leading word to the
//! end of its layout and writes those from its image's first word to the
//! end of the new one; an XOR has always started at the pivot's leading
//! word.  Wall time is reported beside it.
//!
//! ## What decides the cost: which variable the solver splits on
//!
//! Re-reducing a displaced row costs one XOR per pivot it crosses, so the
//! method's cost is the number of displaced rows times the density of the
//! basis.  Both depend on the **split variable**.  A reduced row's pivot
//! is its largest monomial under DegRevLex, so pivots are biased toward
//! the large variables; splitting on the lowest-indexed free variable (the
//! historical `LowestFree` rule) picks exactly those, and deep in the tree
//! half the basis is displaced per level.  Splitting on the smallest free
//! variable ([`super::koblitz_groebner::SplitRule::HighestFree`]) displaces
//! the fewest rows: the engine's work halves on every quadratic rung and
//! its loss on the chained cubic `m = 3` systems — whose 40%-rank-deficient
//! matrices make the reduced rows dense — turns into a `1.9×` win on the
//! deep `K_0/2^15` cell (`RESEARCH_INHERITED_F4.md` §3.5).  Restoring
//! reduced form after each level, cost-triggered fallbacks and
//! drift-triggered rebuilds were all tried and rejected; each cost more
//! than it saved.
//!
//! ## What this does not change
//!
//! Nothing about the algebra: same degree, same row space, same splitting
//! rule, same node budget.  Nothing about the decomposition oracle's cost
//! at `n = 131`, which is bounded by how many candidate tuples must be
//! ruled out and not by how one node's matrix is reduced.
