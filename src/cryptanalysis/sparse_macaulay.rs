//! # Structured sparse elimination for binary Macaulay matrices.
//!
//! The solving-degree measurement in
//! [`super::koblitz_groebner::solving_profile`] is bounded by one dense
//! `F_2` row reduction.  At `n = 5, m = 3` that reduction is 8 340 rows
//! over 21 778 columns and takes about eight minutes; at 27 unknowns —
//! the `n = 9` and `n = 15` cells, which are the ones that would turn a
//! single measured gap into a scaling claim — degree 6 needs 397 594
//! columns and the same dense pass runs to roughly a fortnight per draw.
//! That is the wall, and it is a representation problem rather than a
//! mathematical one.
//!
//! ## Why not Wiedemann or Lanczos
//!
//! Those solve a sparse system or find a kernel vector.  The measurement
//! needs neither: it asks whether the reduced row space contains the
//! constant `1` (a refutation), and whether it contains `v` or `v + 1`
//! for each variable (a pinned unknown).  Those are questions about a
//! *reduced basis*, which a Krylov method does not produce.  Plain
//! Lanczos is doubly wrong here — its normal-equations step is unsound
//! over `F_2`, where a nonzero vector can be self-orthogonal, which is
//! why production GF(2) linear algebra uses *block* Wiedemann.
//!
//! So this is structured Gaussian elimination, the same family as
//! [`super::koblitz_sparse_la`]'s filtering stage, over a different
//! field and aimed at a different question.
//!
//! ## The structure that makes it cheap
//!
//! [`super::pq_groebner_f2::cmp_mono`] orders monomials by total degree
//! first, and the Macaulay builder sorts columns *descending*.  So the
//! high-degree monomials occupy the leading columns and the degree-≤1
//! monomials and the constant occupy the tail.  Rows are stored as
//! ascending column indices, so a row's leading index is its minimum —
//! and therefore
//!
//! ```text
//!     leading index ≥ the degree-≤1 boundary
//!         ⟺  the row's whole support lies in the tail
//!         ⟺  the row is a linear consequence of the system.
//! ```
//!
//! That equivalence is what lets the expensive half of the work be
//! restricted to the high columns and done sparsely:
//!
//! 1. Echelonise by leading column across the high columns only,
//!    choosing the lowest-weight row in each column's bucket as pivot to
//!    hold down fill-in.
//! 2. Whatever is left with a leading index past the boundary is exactly
//!    the set of linear consequences, and spans at most `n_vars + 1`
//!    columns.
//! 3. Reduce *that* block densely.  Echelon form alone is not enough —
//!    `{v + w, w}` has to reduce to `{v, w}` before `v` reads as pinned —
//!    but the full reduction now runs on a 65-column block instead of a
//!    65 000-column one.
