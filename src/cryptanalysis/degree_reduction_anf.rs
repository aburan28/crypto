//! # Lever L2 — does symmetrisation lower the solving degree?
//!
//! The degree-reduction thread's remaining untested lever. Iterations 1–4
//! settled the others: hybrid slicing is killed, degree falls pay only where
//! the base degree is high, their composition is killed, and the `Δ_low`
//! screen turned out to be a size proxy — so L2 must be scored the way
//! iterations 2 and 3 scored their levers: **measured `D*` and total work at
//! matched shape**, not a defect correlation.
//!
//! ## Why `S₄`, and why the rest of the thread could not test this
//!
//! Symmetrisation's saving scales like `m!`. The rest of this thread runs on
//! `S₃` (`m = 2`), where `m! = 2` — essentially nothing. Testing L2 there
//! would measure noise. [`binary_semaev_s4`] already carries a symmetrised
//! `S₄` descent at `m = 3`, which is both the first `m` where index calculus
//! beats Pollard ρ at all and the first where `m!` is worth having.
//!
//! ## The two presentations of one ideal
//!
//! [`S4System`] gives the symmetrised model in two halves:
//!
//! | half | variables | degree | count |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | correspondence `e_{i,d} = σ_i(x)_d` | x ∪ e | ≤ 3 | `6ℓ − 3` |
//! | descended `S₄` | e only | ≤ 2 | `n` |
//!
//! Eliminating `e` by substituting `e_{i,d} := σ_i(x)_d` gives the **same
//! ideal** presented over the `x` variables alone, at degree ≤ 6 (quadratic
//! in `e`, each `e` cubic in `x`). That is the non-symmetrised baseline, and
//! it needs no new algebra — only substitution — so the comparison is exact
//! rather than approximate.
//!
//! So L2 is a pure presentation question of the kind this thread was built
//! to ask: same ideal, `9ℓ − 3` variables at low degree versus `3ℓ`
//! variables at high degree. Which does the Macaulay tower prefer?
//!
//! ## What had to be built
//!
//! The thread's harness is quadratic-only ([`F2BoolPoly`] holds degree ≤ 2).
//! Both halves here exceed that, so this module carries an **arbitrary-degree
//! ANF** Macaulay path ([`anf_macaulay_rows`], [`anf_refutation_scan`]) that
//! reuses the same bit-packed elimination and the same "is `1` in the row
//! space" refutation test as the rest of the thread, so the `D*` numbers are
//! commensurable with iterations 1–4.
//!
